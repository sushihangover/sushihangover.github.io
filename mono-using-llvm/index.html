<p>When configuring Mono to use llvm, if you receiving the error:</p>

<p><strong>configure: error: Cross compiling is not supported for target i386-apple-darwin11.2.0</strong></p>

<p>Then the llvm-config that is currently the first hit in your path and that is begin picked up by the mono autogen/configure script is does not match the target that you are trying to build in mono.</p>

<p><strong>llvm-config &ndash;host-target</strong> should help you out and change your path so the correct llvm bin directory is first in the list so when mono&rsquo;s configure runs llvm-config it gets the correct info.</p>
