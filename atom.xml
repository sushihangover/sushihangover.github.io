    <link href="http://sushihangover.github.io/gcc-4-dot-9-is-out-with-arm-enhancements"/>
    <updated>2014-04-22T18:35:15-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://sushihangover.github.io/gcc-4-dot-9-is-out-with-arm-enhancements</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>GCC 4.9 is out with in the wild now with a long list of ARM enhancements. I&rsquo;m hoping to look at into a few of the items on their <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.9/changes.html">change/log list</a>.</p>

<p>One of them is the &ldquo;<strong>-mslow-flash-data</strong>&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m really interested in what they are doing when this option is used. Using QEMU and LLVM I create variable and function usage maps during the last stage of speed optimizations and tag the high use items to be moved to RX to any remaining XRW (RAM) during startup in the reset_handler (would really be nice to burn that routine in the feedback loop of the LLVM profiler, need to create perf records that could be fed to the <a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmdev/2014-April/072138.html">LLVM AutoFDO Converter</a> that Google did and have it spew out &lsquo;linker scriptets&rsquo;&hellip;. too many ideas, not enough time at get them all done ;&ndash;)</p>

<p>So what is listed in the man for &ldquo;-mslow-flash-data&rdquo; is:
<strong>Assume loading data from flash is slower than fetching instruction. Therefore literal load is minimized for better performance. This option is only supported when compiling for ARMv7 M-profile and off by default.</strong></p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Is ARMv6 M-profile really excluded in whatever they are doing with mslow-flash-data? Only M3 and M4x support? Need to find the commit(s) for this feature.'>
Is ARMv6 M-profile really excluded in whatever they are doing with mslow-flash-data? Only M3 and M4x support? Need to find the commit(s) for this feature.</p>

<p>Also everyone always loves items like: <strong>A number of code generation improvements for Thumb2 to reduce code size when compiling for the M-profile processors</strong>. Free code size reduction is always a great thing when during with those dirt-cheap <a href="http://www.nuvoton.com/NuvotonMOSS/Community/ProductInfo.aspx?tp_GUID=5dbf7d7a-b6df-4fe1-91c9-063449500ce7">Nuvoton NuMicro M0 chips</a>, well, assuming it comes with using &ldquo;-Os&rdquo; and not with a speed impact when throughput matters more&hellip; small is good, but it is not always what everyone needs.</p>

<p>And the &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_allocation">Local Register Allocator</a>&rdquo; is turned on for ARM by default:
<code>The Local Register Allocator, introduced in GCC 4.8.0 for ia32 and x86-64 targets only, is now used also on the Aarch64, ARM, S/390 and ARC targets by default..</code>
</span></p>

<p>Getting it compiled on OS-X proved to be a pain as I do not have a native build of GCC, just clang acting as gcc, and could not get a  ARM-NONE-EABI 4.9.0 version built using clang. One of the issues that I could not work around was:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>clang: error: unsupported option '-static-libgcc'</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Well, duh&hellip;, clang does not support that option, but not clear on why that is showing up under the 4.9.0 build using the same configure options as 4.8.x. Manually hacking on the make files to get passed this and I ended up getting into other issues, so I give up and built an OS-X &lsquo;native&rsquo; gcc that I then used to build the ARM-NONE-EABI cross-compiler to get around the orginal &ldquo;-static-libgcc&rdquo; issue. Never had any problems doing a &ldquo;make all-gcc&rdquo; or &ldquo;make all&rdquo; to build gcc 4.8.x with clang->gcc before.</p>

<p>So I build a native version on the master branch (4.10.x now):</p>

<p>ARM enhancements from the change list include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>ARM:</strong></li>
<li>Use of Advanced SIMD (Neon) for 64-bit scalar computations has been disabled by default. This was found to generate better code in only a small number of cases. It can be turned back on with the -mneon-for-64bits option.</li>
<li>Further support for the ARMv8-A architecture, notably implementing the restriction around IT blocks in the Thumb32 instruction set has been added. The -mrestrict-it option can be used with -march=armv7-a or the -march=armv7ve options to make code generation fully compatible with the deprecated instructions in ARMv8-A.</li>
<li>Support has now been added for the ARMv7ve variant of the architecture. This can be used by the -march=armv7ve option.</li>
<li>The ARMv8-A crypto and CRC instructions are now supported through intrinsics and are available through the -march=armv8-a+crc and mfpu=crypto-neon-fp-armv8 options.</li>
<li>LRA is now on by default for the ARM target. This can be turned off using the -mno-lra option. This option is purely transitionary command line option and will be removed in a future release. We are interested in any bug reports regarding functional and performance regressions with LRA.</li>
<li><strong>A new option -mslow-flash-data to improve performance of programs fetching data on slow flash memory has now been introduced for the ARMv7-M profile cores.</strong></li>
<li>A new option -mpic-data-is-text-relative for targets that allows data segments to be relative to text segments has been added. This is on by default for all targets except VxWorks RTP.</li>
<li>A number of infrastructural changes have been made to both the ARM and AArch64 backends to facilitate improved code-generation.</li>
<li>GCC now supports Cortex-A12 and the Cortex-R7 through the -mcpu=cortex-a12 and -mcpu=cortex-r7 options.</li>
<li>GCC now has tuning for the Cortex-A57 and Cortex-A53 through the -mcpu=cortex-a57 and -mcpu=cortex-a53 options.
Initial big.LITTLE tuning support for the combination of Cortex-A57 and Cortex-A53 was added through the -mcpu=cortex-a57.cortex-a53 option. Similar support was added for the combination of Cortex-A15 and Cortex-A7 through the -mcpu=cortex-a15.cortex-a7 option.</li>
<li>Further performance optimizations for the Cortex-A15 and the Cortex-M4 have been added.</li>
<li><p><strong> A number of code generation improvements for Thumb2 to reduce code size when compiling for the M-profile processors.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>AArch64:</strong></p></li>
<li>The ARMv8-A crypto and CRC instructions are now supported through intrinsics. These are enabled when the architecture supports these and are available through the -march=armv8-a+crc and -march=armv8-a+crypto options.</li>
<li>Initial support for ILP32 has now been added to the compiler. This is now available through the command line option -mabi=ilp32. + Support for ILP32 is considered experimental as the ABI specification is still beta.</li>
<li>Coverage of more of the ISA including the SIMD extensions has been added. The Advanced SIMD intrinsics have also been improved.</li>
<li>The new local register allocator (LRA) is now on by default for the AArch64 backend.</li>
<li>The REE (Redundant extension elimination) pass has now been enabled by default for the AArch64 backend.</li>
<li>Tuning for the Cortex-A53 and Cortex-A57 has been improved.</li>
<li>Initial big.LITTLE tuning support for the combination of Cortex-A57 and Cortex-A53 was added through the -mcpu=cortex-a57.cortex-a53 option.</li>
<li>A number of structural changes have been made to both the ARM and AArch64 backends to facilitate improved code-generation.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='LLVM 3.4.1 just incorporates stable bug-fixes while all major feature development is focused on landing for LLVM 3.5.'>
Doing point releases have been talked a lot about in the past but they&rsquo;ve never materialized up to now with this open-source compiler infrastructure seeing major releases once every six months. Fortunately, in covering the time until LLVM 3.5 in three months, LLVM 3.4.1 will finally be made. Tom Stellard at AMD who has been working a lot on the AMD LLVM GPU back-end and other open-source Radeon OpenCL code, has been organizing this point release management. The LLVM 3.4.1 release plans were originally shared last month. LLVM 3.4.1 just incorporates stable bug-fixes while all major feature development is focused on landing for LLVM 3.5.
</span></p>

<p>The official LLVM 3.4.1 release is planned for 4-18 assuming that all of the testing goes well. Details for testing can be found via the<a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmdev/2014-April/072066.html"> LLVM mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>I am staying on the bleeding-edge for my bare metal ARM work, so I will continue to stay on the master branch (3.5.0):</p>

    <updated>2014-04-11T07:28:16-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://sushihangover.github.io/arm-llvm-and-why-no-gpl</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a follow up to my last post about ARM&rsquo;s annoucement concerning their move to clang/LLVM.</p>

<p>Seems that more of the GPL-only mindset are upset that ARM is another company that is picking up and carrying the LLVM torch for their future development activities.</p>

<p>My take on it is it is a good thing, something they could not do with GCC without violating the GPL license that they would have to follow.  Clang/LLVM is licensed with a BSD-style license and not wanting to get in to a religious war over open source licensing, their LLVM selection and thus license choice allows them to keep things proprietary while working on new designs and code and releasing that to development partners like they currently do with their in-house ARM/Keli development environment. Then there is the problem of linking and including non-open code in end-user projects if they would have chosen GCC, this is a non-trivial problem for private and public companies dealing with IP that has extreme competition.</p>

<p>As ARM&rsquo;s new designs become public, they can then push LLVM changes to the public branch and, we as end-users, then get to enjoy the benefits of what they can release. Will there be code components that they alway keep private and/or charge for in their commerical &lsquo;ulitmate&rsquo; compiler version, maybe, but the code that does make it to the git repo will be vetted by the company that actually produces the MCU designs. Good enough for me, GPL be damned in this case&hellip;</p>

    <id>http://sushihangover.github.io/arm-starts-move-to-llvm</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Very cool news from ARM Holding the other day. They are formally adopting clang/LLVM as their future compiler. If you have been following LLVM commits, you might have noticed that AArch64 support has been making progress for quite some time, and now ARM is publicly releasing v6 of their compiler:</p>

<blockquote><p>ARM announces the availability of version 6 of the ARM Compiler, the reference code generation toolchain for the ARM® architecture. ARM Compiler 6 adopts the Clang and LLVM open source compiler framework, channeling contributions from the whole ARM Partnership to improve code quality, performance and power efficiency of software on ARM processors.</p>

<p>The flexible and modern Clang and LLVM infrastructure provides a solid foundation for ARM&rsquo;s code generation tools. Clang is a C/C++ compiler front end based on a modular architecture with well-defined interfaces for applying complimentary tools such as code analyzers and code generators. Clang also offers improved diagnostic capabilities, leading to higher quality code and shorter development cycles.</p></blockquote>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'>No machine specified, and there is no default.
</span><span class='line'>Use -machine help to list supported machines!</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So now, you will need to include any machine (&mdash;machine help) in order to see the cpu listing, using the ARM Cortex-M0+ dev board that I am putting together (<em>sushi-m0plus-board</em>), you can get the cpu listing.</p>

<blockquote><p>The cores; cortex-m0, cortex-m0+ and machine; sushi-m0plus-board, are my additions and not apart of the QEMU main-line code.</p></blockquote>

    <id>http://sushihangover.github.io/bkpt-service-calls-on-the-cortex-m0</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.openjtag.org"><img class="left" src="http://sushihangover.github.io/images/openjtag2_small.jpg" title="&#34;OpenJTAG&#34;" alt="&#34;OpenJTAG&#34;"></a> I tend to use semi-hosting via QEMU simluation and OpenJTAG/OpenOCD a lot; i.e.: for debugging, simulating sensor input and output, setting the RTC on a board for the first time and while the RMI Monitor interface is built-in to newlib stdio functions like printf, using a library like stdio is not really an option when a core only has 8k of ROM and 2k of RAM. So I need a really small printf routine to use on cores like the <a href="http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/prod_summary.jsp?code=KL03">Kinetis KL03</a> (MKL03Z32CAF4R)</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</span><span class='line'>  RAM (xrw)       : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 0x00800 /* 2K */
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There are a lot of embedded printf routines posted with a variety of features and mine is just a collection/combo of various standard practices. The main difference of mine is it normally uses SVC/BKPT routines to perform the &lsquo;print&rsquo; output and I <em>try</em> to make sure that optimizations via LLVM are taken advantage of.</p>

<p>So the question of how small of a routine is it as otherwise it is useless on something like the &lsquo;world&rsquo;s smallest ARM&rsquo; <a href="http://cache.freescale.com/files/microcontrollers/doc/fact_sheet/KINETISKL03CSPFS.pdf?fpsp=1&amp;Parent_nodeId=1390844042446720950044&amp;Parent_pageType=product">KL03</a>? Lets start with a newlib stdio version that uses the default syscalls that have RMI enabled. First you have to some heap as newlib printf using malloc.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>#include &lt;stdio.h>
</span><span class='line'>#include "printf_svc.h"
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>int main (void)
</span><span class='line'>{
</span><span class='line'>  printf("BKPT Hello World\n");
</span><span class='line'>  printf("How small is this?\n");
</span><span class='line'>  
</span><span class='line'>  svcExit(); // QEMU system exit
</span><span class='line'>  
</span><span class='line'>  while (1) { };
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The code size of the complete program above is huge if you are trying to run it on a Cortex-M0+ that only has 8K of ROM and 2k of RAM. Over 32K of ROM and 2+K of RAM just to output two lines of code!</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
</span><span class='line'>  33160    2304    1256   36720    8f70 bin/main.axf</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So lets use a printf that is self-contained and uses no heap (malloc) and update our test code:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
<span class='line-number'>16</span>
<span class='line-number'>17</span>
<span class='line-number'>18</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>#include "printf.h"
</span><span class='line'>#include "printf_svc.h"
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>void putc (void* p, char c)
</span><span class='line'>{
</span><span class='line'>  svcPutChar(&c);
</span><span class='line'>}
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>int main (void)
</span><span class='line'>{
</span><span class='line'>  set_putc(putc);
</span><span class='line'>  printf("BKPT Hello World\n");
</span><span class='line'>  printf("How small is this?\n");
</span><span class='line'>  
</span><span class='line'>  svcExit(); // QEMU system exit
</span><span class='line'>  
</span><span class='line'>  while (1) { };
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now that is more like it, 2k of ROM and 64 bytes of RAM: Debug code size:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
</span><span class='line'>   2102      64      10    2176     880 bin/main.axf</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In release configuration it is even better, ~1k of ROM is use, RAM is the same as expected; Release code size, LLVM compiled with -Os, linked with -O4:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
</span><span class='line'>   1106      64      10    1180     49c bin/main.axf</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Adding 10 more printf statements that each contain a <em>different</em> but static 10 char string only adds 210 bytes to the ROM. Removing the 100 bytes for static string allocation, that breaks down to 10 bytes for the printf call. This can be improved upon a little, but 10 bytes is acceptable for now.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
</span><span class='line'>   1316      64       8    1388     56c bin/main.axf</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>A quick break down of elf size:</p>

<p><strong>text</strong>: your code, vector table plus constants.</p>

<p><strong>data</strong>: Initialized variables, and it counts for RAM and FLASH. The linker allocates data in FLASH which then is <em>copied</em> from ROM to RAM in the startup code (<em>in startup.c via the Reset_Handler function in my case</em>)</p>

<p><strong>bss</strong>: Uninitialized data in RAM which is initialized with zero in the startup code (<em>again see the Reset_Handler function</em>)</p>

<p>But I was wondering how much <a href="http://ds.arm.com">ARM&rsquo;s DS-5</a> (Keil) IDE and compiler cost and found a couple of places in the &lsquo;net that actually publish the prices (like <a href="http://www.newark.com">Newark / Element14</a>):</p>

<h5>ARM DS-5 PROFESSIONAL:</h5>

<h5>Floating license price: $10,750.00 (USD)</h5>

<h5>Node locked price: $6,600.00 (USD)</h5>

<p>Ouch! I used their eval offer and if I was doing ARM coding full-time, yes, 10 grand for what they offer would be a no-brainer.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://sushihangover.github.io/images/ARM_DSTREAM.jpg" title="&#34;ARM DSTREAM&#34;" alt="&#34;ARM DSTREAM&#34;">What I really would like to have is the ARM/Keil <a href="http://ds.arm.com/ds-5/debug/dstream/">DStream</a> (debug &amp; trace unit) at <em>only</em> $3,500 USD (<a href="http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/DSTRM-KT-0181A/DSTRM-KT-0181A-ND/2522245">DigiKey</a>)&hellip;. damn is it nice, 4GB of trace buffer, 60 Mhz JTAG, etc&hellip;  But again like so many other embedded vendors they only offer Windows and Linux support. Never understood the standpoint of supporting Linux and not OS-X. Windows <strong>only</strong> support I actually understand from a marketshare point of view and optimizing drivers and software is a lot of work, but if you are going to support Linux, you might as well add another 5% to your dev budget and support OS-X.</p>

<p>Mfg Part No: <a href="http://www.newark.com/arm/dstrm-kt-0181a/debugtrace-unit-linux-for-arm/dp/75T9199">DSTRM-KT-0181A </a>: Price: $3500</p>

<p>While technically speaking QEMU does not have a &ldquo;Cortex-M0(+)&rdquo; cpu in its feature set, it does have a M3 core and I have used it to create some Cortex-M0+ cpus that model some cores from a couple of ARM vendors, and then added some supporting dev boards (&lsquo;machines&rsquo; per QEMU nomenclature). I&rsquo;ve been waiting till the QEMU 2.0 release to get my new ARM coding sorted out as major versions usually cause large changes in APIs, C headers, usage patterns, etc&hellip; and well, QEMU is tough enough to work through and I did not plan on doing it twice&hellip;</p>

<p>Well, we are getting close, <a href="http://wiki.qemu.org/ChangeLog/2.0">QEMU 2.0 RC0</a> just released as a tar ball (not in the git repo?), so I did the download, configured and built on OS-X for &ldquo;arm-softmmu&rdquo;. Everything is great so far, ran some of my work through it and have not found anything amiss. Interesting that the version that shows up as <strong>QEMU emulator version 1.7.90</strong> (BTW: the version on the git master branch is 1.7.5?)</p>

<p>There are a few new machines available:</p>

<pre><code>* canon-a1100          Canon PowerShot A1100 IS
* cubieboard           cubietech cubieboard
* virt                 ARM Virtual Machine
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href="http://cubieboard.org">cubie</a> board makes sense as you can  use it to test Linux image builds and what-not. I am not sure of the usage pattern for the &ldquo;Canon PowerShot A1100 DIGIC&rdquo;, is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIGIC">DIGIC</a> 4 Image Processor available for purchuse? I&rsquo;ll have to look into this one as it leaves me confused.</p>

<p>The interesting one is the fact that there is now a &lsquo;virt&rsquo; machine for ARM. I&rsquo;m not sure that I will personally have a use for using <a href="http://wiki.libvirt.org/page/Virtio">virtio</a> devices in any embedded ARM dev work, but you never know.</p>

<p>Nothing new in the ARM cpu listing, so I guess I will continue with my ARM core and machine work&hellip;</p>

<p>The change log for ARM shows the following:</p>

<pre><code>* Support for "-M virt", a board type that only uses virtio devices
* Support for "-cpu host" when running under KVM
* Support for new 32-bit mode ARMv8 instructions in TCG
* Support for AArch64 disassembling (requires a C++ compiler to be installed on the host)
* Support for AArch64 user-mode emulation
* Initial support for KVM on AArch64 systems (some features such as migration are not yet implemented)
* Support for the Canon PowerShot A1100 DIGIC board using "-M canon-a1100"
* Support for the allwinner-a10-based board "-M cubieboard"
* Support for flow control in the Cadence UART

This time around, lets use the CMSIS abstraction layer to access the SysTick core peripheral.</p>

<p>This peripheral can be used to provide the core timer to an embedded RTOS kernel, such as FreeRTOS, or to provide application timing events to know when to read some attached sensors or such. In the most basic form, it provides a pollable countdown value. This value is decreased from a user settable value (<a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dai0179b/ar01s02s08.html">Reload Value</a>) on every clock tick. If it configured as an interrupt, the function assigned activates every n+1 clock ticks.</p>

<p>I used Clang/LLVM to compile a simple app that shows you how to set the reload value, read (poll) the internal SysTick value or enable it as an interrupt.</p>

<p>The semihosting output of this app (via QEMU):</p>

    <updated>2014-03-05T22:34:20-08:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.arm.com/products/processors/cortex-m/cortex-microcontroller-software-interface-standard.php"><img class="left" src="http://sushihangover.github.io/images/cmsis-version-3-block-diagram.png" title="&#34;CMSIS Version 3 Block Diagram (Source: Arm.com)&#34;" alt="&#34;CMSIS Version 3 Block Diagram (Source: Arm.com)&#34;"></a> I added ARM&rsquo;s CMSIS 3.01 to my LLVM project and wanted to test out the pre-compiled DSP libraries that are supplied.</p>

<p>I borrowed one of the cos/sin examples and added some semihosting <em>printf</em>s using NEWLIB and cleaned up the code a bit.</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.arm.com/products/processors/cortex-m/cortex-microcontroller-software-interface-standard.php?tab=Download+CMSIS">CMSIS-DSP</a>: DSP Library Collection with over 60 Functions for various data types: fix-point (fractional q7, q15, q31) and single precision floating-point (32-bit). The library is available for Cortex-M0, Cortex-M3, and Cortex-M4. The Cortex-M4 implementation is optimized for the SIMD instruction set.</p></blockquote>

<p>Updating my Makefile to include the correct CMSIS libraries (<em>arm_cortexM3l_math</em>) for the ld and the currect headers for Clang/LLVM and the result <em>works great</em> for Cortex-M3. I copied the project over and mod&rsquo;d the Makefile so it picks up the correct Cortex-M0 lib (<em>arm_cortexM0l_math</em>) and everything looks on this core also.</p>

<p>Clang/LLVM compile and link:</p>

    <updated>2014-03-05T06:30:13-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://sushihangover.github.io/cortex-m0-vs-m3-llvm-and-ld</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://sushihangover.github.io/images/ARM_Cortex-M_instruction_set_large.png"><img class="left" src="http://sushihangover.github.io/images/ARM_Cortex-M_instruction_set_small.png" title="&#34;ARM Cortex-M instruction set&#34;" alt="&#34;ARM Cortex-M instruction set&#34;"></a> One of the issues that you run into using Clang/LLVM as your compiler for bare-metal ARM Cortex cores is you have to directly use arm-none-eabi-ld to do your linking.</p>

<p>Directly using <strong>ld</strong> can be a bit nerve wrecking at times to get the options correct (and the <strong>order</strong> of options does matter) as normally you are just let gcc use collect2 and have it internally execute ld to perform your linking.</p>

<p>One of the areas using it directly that can bite you is not linking to the proper libgcc.a for the Cortex-M that you are targeting. Looking into your <em>arm-none-eabi/lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/X.X.X</em> tool-chain directory and you will find multiple directories. One for each ARM architecture; armv6-m, armv7-ar, armv7-m, thumb, thumb2, etc&hellip;</p>

<p>Add a library include for <em>architecture</em> directory that matches the core that you compiled against and everything will be fine:</p>

<p>Cortex M3 example:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am working on a custom NEWLIB but first I wanted to make sure that <a href="https://sourceware.org/newlib/">NEWLIB</a> compiled for ARM-NONE-EABI works out of the box with my ARM bare-metal <a href="http://llvm.org">Clang/LLVM</a> build and Qemu.</p>

<p>Lets start with a simple main() that includes printf, puts and malloc. The first test is related to malloc, as if your linker script is not setting up your heap properly and providing the heap &ldquo;end&rdquo; address as defined in NEWLIB then not much else is going to work (i.e. printf uses malloc). If malloc works, then lets so some printfs including one with a random string. After that lets keep increasing the size of our mallocs till we run out of heap space.</p>

<p>Ok, now that we have a linker script that defines our stack and heap properly, lets reuse our startup.c routine for the Cortex-M cores and compile it all with CLang/LLVM and link it with arm-none-eabi-ld:</p>

    <link href="http://sushihangover.github.io/bare-metal-debugging-with-affinic-debugger"/>
    <updated>2014-02-26T23:19:58-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://sushihangover.github.io/bare-metal-debugging-with-affinic-debugger</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://sushihangover.github.io/images/Affinic_gui_large.png"><img class="left" src="http://sushihangover.github.io/images/Affinic_gui_small.png" title="&#34;Affinic gdb on OS-X&#34;" alt="&#34;Affinic gdb on OS-X&#34;"></a> I am not currently using a full IDE for my bare metal C coding on OS-X. Thus is mainly due to my usage of an <a href="https://github.com/sushihangover/llvm_baremetal">ARM targeting Clang/LLVM build</a>) since I am compiling to LLVM <strong>bitcode</strong>, piping to <strong>opts</strong> and than handing the resulting object files directly to <strong>arm-none-eabi-ld</strong>. Makefile creation is the only way to get this build pipeline working as no IDE on any OS is natively supporting using LLVM as a cross-compiler for bare metal ARM (yet!).</p>

<p>Thus that leaves me in a term window a lot, not that I mind, but gdb (arm-none-eabi-gdb) based debugging can be a pain when you are used to working with a fully intergated IDE (<em>I dream of Visual Studio style bare metal debugging</em> ;&ndash;) . The &lsquo;layout asm&rsquo; and &lsquo;layout src&rsquo; text-based <em>gui</em>  of gdb does help a lot but till you learn all the commands and setup custom command-sets, productivity tends to suffer&hellip;</p>

<p>There are several GUI-based interfaces that can ease the pain of using gdb. <strong>Eclipse</strong> has the CDT debug perspective that provides a complete wrapper to <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-eclipse-cdt-debug2/index.html">gdb MI commands</a> and <strong>ddd</strong> (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ddd/">Data Display Debugger</a>) provides a frontend to many session based cmd-line debuggers, including gdb. But I figured I would give <a href="http://www.affinic.com">Affinic Debugger</a> a quick try to see how it work.</p>

<p>Using Affinic Debugger for GDB does not completely shield you from gdb and you also have access to the gdb terminal so as you  learn gdb commands you can type them vs. clicking your way throught the GUI.</p>

<blockquote><p>You can use it as a gdb learning tool, as all the gui actions that involve gdb cmds are echo&rsquo;d in the intergated terminal.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://sushihangover.github.io/images/Affinic_preferences_large.png"><img class="right" src="http://sushihangover.github.io/images/Affinic_preferences_small.png" title="&#34;Affinic gdb location&#34;" alt="&#34;Affinic gdb location&#34;"></a>After you download and install it, you will need to set which gdb you are using to debug your target. I am using a version of arm-none-eabi-gdb that I built, so start the app and open the Preferences and change the &ldquo;Set Debugger Path&rdquo; entry to the gdb that you are using. Affinic Debugger will need to restart after that change.</p>

<p>Lets debug something!</p>

<p>Using the HelloWorld example from last time, let re-compile it with Clang/LLVM using &ldquo;-g -O0&rdquo; so we get the debug symbols (-g) and remove any code optimizations (-O0) so the generated assembly is easy to follow and allow breakpoints to be set with the source code (depending upon optimization level, your breakpoints might be limited in the source view):</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</span><span class='line'>arm-none-eabi-size bin/HelloWorldSimple.axf
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Lets startup QEMU as we will use it as our remote gdb debugging  target.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>qemu-system-arm -M versatilepb -m 128M -nographic -kernel  bin/HelloWorldSimple.axf -s -S
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note: We are using the two following additional options in order to remotely debug our HelloWorldSimple.axf program:</p>

<h6>* -s              shorthand for -gdb tcp::1234</h6>

<h6>* -S              freeze CPU at startup</h6>

<p>Now start Affinic and connect to the QEMU gdb remote debugging server that is running. Enter the following into the &ldquo;Command:&rdquo; text field:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>target remote localhost:1234
</span><span class='line'>file bin/HelloWorldSimple.axf</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note: This is the same are if you were using gdb on the cmd-line. You can also use the Affinic menus to do this (Remote and File menus)</p>

<p><a href="http://sushihangover.github.io/images/Affinic_assembly_view_large.png"><img class="left" src="http://sushihangover.github.io/images/Affinic_assembly_view_small.png" title="&#34;Affinic gdb on OS-X&#34;" alt="&#34;Affinic gdb on OS-X&#34;"></a> You will see the assembly and source tabs filed. At this point you can set breakpoints, step through your source/assembly code, view register values, etc&hellip;
<a href="http://sushihangover.github.io/images/Affinic_source_view_large.png"><img class="right" src="http://sushihangover.github.io/images/Affinic_source_view_small.png" title="&#34;Affinic gdb on OS-X&#34;" alt="&#34;Affinic gdb on OS-X&#34;"></a></p>

<p>So far I like the Affinic Debugger interface, but I guess time will tell if I buy the full version after the 30 day trail, use the limited light/free version or setup ddd and/or Eclipse on my MacBookPro&hellip;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://sushihangover.github.io/images/ARM_Semihosting_large.png"><img class="left" src="http://sushihangover.github.io/images/ARM_Semihosting.png" title="&#34;ARM Semihosting&#34;" alt="&#34;ARM Semihosting&#34;"></a> <strong><a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0471c/Bgbjjgij.html">What is semihosting?</a></strong> <em>&hellip;Examples of these facilities include keyboard input, screen output, and disk I/O. For example, you can use this mechanism to enable functions in the C library, such as printf() and scanf(), to use the screen and keyboard of the host instead of having a screen and keyboard on the target system&hellip;</em></p>

<p>So you need to output some debug messages via your host debugging session (via JTAG or such) or working with QEMU to prototype some ARM code? Well semihosting is simple use, but it can come at a large price in memory and overhead if you use stdio to do it&hellip;</p>

<p>You can skip the &ldquo;#include &lt;stdio.h>&rdquo; and linking the semihosting newlib library (assuming you have the syscalls inplementated) and just use some simple inline assembly to get the job done.</p>

<p>Lets take a quick look at two of the twenty-some service calls (SVC) that are available, SYS_WRITEC (0x03) and WRITE0 (0x04).</p>

<h5>* SYS_WRITEC outputs a single character, an address pointer to that character is loaded in register R1. Register R0 is loaded with 0x03 and then you can execute a <em>SuperVisor Call</em> (SVC 0x00123456).</h5>

<h5>* SYS_WRITE0 outputs a null-term string, the string&rsquo;s beginning address is stored in R1, R0 is loaded with 0x04 and you execute a supervisor call again.</h5>

<p>If we translate that knowledge into inline assembly:</p>

    <updated>2014-02-23T06:39:45-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://sushihangover.github.io/llvm-and-the-arm-elf-arm-dot-exidx-star-section</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my last <a href="http://sushihangover.github.io/arm-bare-metal-comparing-llvm-to-arm-gcc/">post</a> I did a very basic comparsion of ARM code generation between LLVM and GCC compilers and testing the AXF in Qemu. The stand out difference was LLVM produced a *.ARM.exidx** section in the AXF/ELF while arm-gcc did not. The code is very simple, one .s and one .c file, no .cpp/.h involved.</p>

<p>So what is a <em>.ARM.exidx</em> section?</p>

<p>ARM ELF manual show this under the special sections chapter:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th> Name </th>
<th>￼Type </th>
<th>￼Attributes </th>
<th> </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td> ARM.exidx </td>
<td>￼ SHT_ARM_EXIDX </td>
<td> SHF_ALLOC + SHF_LINK_ORDER </td>
<td> </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>_</p>

<blockquote><p>Names beginning .ARM.exidx name sections containing index entries for section unwinding. Names beginning .ARM.extab name sections containing exception unwinding information. See [EHABI] for details.</p></blockquote>

<p>Table 4_4 from that manual shows the Processor specific section types and our attribute is:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th> Name </th>
<th> Value </th>
<th> Comment </th>
<th> </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td> &ldquo;SHT_ARM_EXIDX&rdquo; </td>
<td> 0x70000001 </td>
<td> </td>
<td> </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>_</p>

<p>So the question remains, what is in the section and what is being created? Lets dump HelloWorldSimple.o and only look at that section:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Relocation section '.rel.ARM.exidx' at offset 0x580 contains 2 entries:
</span><span class='line'> Offset     Info    Type            Sym.Value  Sym. Name
</span><span class='line'>00000000  00000b2a R_ARM_PREL31      00000000   .text
</span><span class='line'>00000008  00000b2a R_ARM_PREL31      00000000   .text
</span><span class='line'>Unwind table index '.ARM.exidx' at offset 0xcc contains 2 entries:

</span><span class='line'>0x54 &lt;c_entry>: 0x1 [cantunwind]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So it added both function calls to the table, but are marked <em>cantunwind</em>, which makes sense, but since nothing in the section can be unwound, why include the section? Using gc-sections during linking does not remove it as it has references to functions that are being used&hellip;</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Research is on-going on this one&#8230;'>
Let do a quick test and add <em>-funwind-tables</em>, recompile and yes we get a fully populated unwind table and using <em>-fno-unwind-tables</em> produces the results from above, so that is the default one that is being use. Research is on-going on this one&hellip;

<p>Additional Reading: <a href="https://sourceware.org/ml/binutils/2009-05/msg00048.html">ARM unwind table linker processing</a>; this concerns a patch to bintutils/ld:</p>

<blockquote><p>The patch below implements linker processing of ARM unwinding tables
(SHT_ARM_EXIDX).</p>

<p>ARM exception index tables only define the start address of each region. This
means that code with no unwinding information is effectively covered by the
preceding unwinding table entry.</p>

<p>For normal exceptions that doesn&rsquo;t matter so much &ndash; the user should ensure
that any code they throw exceptions through has proper unwinding information.</p></blockquote>

<p>Just as a quick check, I grep&rsquo;d some source and the *.ARM.exidx** section is generated by the ARMELFStreamer:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With the ever maturing and stable ARM backend of LLVM it is hard to find information using it vs. the well known ARM-GCC release.</p>

<p>So lets start with the most simple HelloWorld example and compare LLVM and <a href="https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded">ARM-GCC</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://balau82.wordpress.com/2010/02/28/hello-world-for-bare-metal-arm-using-qemu/">Balau&rsquo;s post</a> is a popular one showing an ARM bare metal Hello World and test using QEMU, so lets start with that one. First, lets reproduce the compile/link steps to make sure it works:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>

</span><span class='line'>Hello world!
</span><span class='line'>QEMU: Terminated</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Works just fine, so lets reproduce that using   my <a href="https://github.com/sushihangover/llvm_baremetal">LLVM bare metal build</a>. All the compiler options are being shown even though some are defaulted in my build of LLVM so you can see everything it is required to get the LLVM bitcode conversion to produce a valid object file for our ARM target (I&rsquo;m using the Clang driver, but you can use LLVM and pipe bitcode through the various tools so you can deeply control the optimization phase):</p>

<h6>Note: I ran strip on the arm-gcc version to remove the empty debug sections that gcc inserts automatically</h6>

<p>The <strong>.startup</strong> are the same size since this code is assembly and no codegen or optimization will happen there.</p>

<p>It is interesting that LLVM inserts a <strong>.ARM.exidx</strong> section even though this is <em>only</em> .c code. I&rsquo;ll have to look at LLVM to see if <em>-funwind-tables</em> and/or <em>-fexceptions</em> are defaulted to on, but I disassemble it below so we can look at that as that is 8 bytes and accounts for the size difference in this really basic example.</p>

<blockquote><p>.ARM.exidx is the section containing information for unwinding the stack</p></blockquote>

<h6>Note: Understanding the <a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ihi0044e/IHI0044E_aaelf.pdf">ARM ELF format</a> is not really required to do bare metal programming, but, understanding how your code is allocated and loaded can maek a world of differences when you are writting linker definitions files for different cores, so send a few minutes and read the 46 pages :&ndash;)</h6>

<p>First the gcc disassembly so we can compare the LLVM version to it:</p>

<p><a href="http://sushihangover.github.io/images/llvm-gcc-diff_large.png"><img class="left" src="http://sushihangover.github.io/images/llvm-gcc-diff_small.png" title="&#34;LLVM vs. GCC Hello World ARM Bare Metal&#34;" alt="&#34;LLVM vs. GCC Hello World ARM Bare Metal&#34;"></a> We can ignore the _Reset section as that is hand coded assembly and the same for both.</p>

<p>The c_entry is interesting as LLVM uses a move to copy the stack register to fp (r11 = frame pointer) which I what I would do, but arm-gcc does an &ldquo;&#8221;add&rdquo;&ldquo; to get fp into the sp and does that by adding fp to register #4(?) This is flagged as general variable for gcc&hellip; I am slightly confused by gcc&rsquo;s choice to do that, now that question is when would #4 not contain zero? The rest of this function is the same between the two compilers.</p>

<p>The print_uart0 function is a hack function as it does not implement FIFO/flow-control to an actual UART, but in this case it points to a memory address where the discontinued ARM Versatile PB dev-board does have a UART and QEMU board simulation echos those writes. I am not going to do a line by line comparision of the generated code as for un-optimized code they are both getting the job done, but in slightly different ways in almost the same number of instructions.</p>

<p>So we are able to produce a working bare metal ARM AXF from LLVM and next time, I will spend a little time on compiler optimizations to see how the two code generators/optimizisers compare&hellip;</p>
