<p>I posted up the PlayScript compiler 3.2.3003 to <a href="https://github.com/sushihangover/playscript">Github</a> which fixes a bunch of build issues, including a clang/ld failure if you are running the latest and greatest version from Apple.</p>

<p>Root repo : playscript-small-build.sh</p>

Commercial licenses seem to be very reasonable and on par with other commercial git products. </span></p>

<p>When you are merging or rebasing hundreds of changing, doing that by hand from the cmd line is dreadful&hellip; I&rsquo;ve been merging the newer branches of Mono into PlayScript and it can be painful since the Apache open-source version PlayScript was pulled by Zynga from Github two years ago without warning.  When you are looking at hundreds of commits, and in a couple of cases, thousands of changes in between release tags and branches of Mono, doing that via the cmd line is doable, but it will give you nightmares. The SmartGui interface just works; walking the source tree, staging/unstaging, ours/theirs resolver, 3-way visual resolver/merge, markdown support, Github integration,  etc&hellip; is just fast and clean and once you learn a few keystroke shortcuts that merge do done in a heartbeat. ;-)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve used a couple of <a href="http://www.git-scm.com/downloads/guis">other git GUIs</a> and merging and rebasing in them just not seem intuitive and the speed of their interfaces when dealing with a repo as large as Mono is killing me and I&rsquo;ve ended up back in the cmd line.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to do a <a href="http://www.git-scm.com/downloads/guis">full and comparative review</a> as this product is free for non-commercial use, so just download a copy and take it for a test drive yourself. I doubt you would will be disappointed.</p>

<p>I posted up the PlayScript compiler 3.2.3001 to <a href="https://github.com/sushihangover/playscript">Github</a> which is a merge of the mono-3.2.3 tag into the playscript-mono branch.</p>

<p>To speed up testing the merge, I am disabling a number of options in the build. Please log any issues via <a href="https://github.com/sushihangover/playscript/issues">Github</a></p>

    <id>http://sushihangover.github.io/blog/playscript-3-dot-2-2002-posted</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://sushihangover.github.io/images/PlayscriptLogo.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I posted up the PlayScript compiler (3.2.2002). This is the last posted release of the Apache licensed open-source version before Zynga pulled it from public domain.</p>

<p>I will be migrating it to the Mono 4.x compiler in the days and weeks ahead before working on finishing and getting the ActionScript language side stable (feature complete?). Not really looking forwarded to the Mono 4.x migration as the number of internal API changes to the mcs compiler since the 3.2.0 release is quite extensive.</p>

<p>If you want to compile and use the current 3.2.2002 release, just autogen.sh like normal.</p>

<p>Note: Due to dependency updates on OS-X since Mono 3.2 was release, I had to supply &ldquo; <u>&ndash;with-tls</u>&rdquo; option as it was auto-selecting <strong>__thread</strong> instead of <strong>_posix</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>./autogen.sh --with-tls=posix --enable-nls=no --prefix=/Users/administrator/mono-install
</code></pre>

<p>Note: Since this is mono 3.x, to build you will need gmcs during the bootstrap process. If you only have Mono 4.x installed, you will need a 3.x mono install to proceed. I just did a separate mono checkout of 3.2 and built it with a different install prefix location. When doing an initial/full compile and install, you can add this 3.2 install location to the front of your PATH and the default mono bootstrap will work cleanly.</p>

    <id>http://sushihangover.github.io/blog/keeping-a-github-fork-up-to-date-with-origin-repo</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the PlayScript work that I am doing on the Mono mcs compiler, keeping the PlayScript compiler in-sync with Mono&rsquo;s mcs can be a pain due to the large number of changes that occur on that repo.</p>

<p>While I have different &lsquo;tricks&rsquo; to try to help merging, the first thing is you have to keep one branch of your fork in-sync with the original repo that your forked, mono/mono.git in my case.</p>

<p>I created two local clones of my GitHub forked repo and added an &lsquo;upstream&rsquo; remote to the original mono repo.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>git remote -v
</span><span class='line'>origin    https://github.com/sushihangover/PlayScript.git <span class="o">(</span>fetch<span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>origin    https://github.com/sushihangover/PlayScript.git <span class="o">(</span>push<span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>upstream  https://github.com/mono/mono.git <span class="o">(</span>fetch<span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>upstream  https://github.com/mono/mono.git <span class="o">(</span>push<span class="o">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>One local clone is named <strong>PlayScript-master</strong> and the other is <strong>PlayScript</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>PlayScript-master</strong> is used to keep in-sync with the upstream repo, build the bleed-edge mono framework and compiler and run the mono unit-tests. This is so I always know what the current mono master looks like and how the unit tests are running so I can review the changes I am making in the local <strong>PlayScript</strong> repo and make sure that I am not injecting regression failures in the C# side of the compiler. (I&rsquo;ll blog about that later). While the <strong>PlayScript-master repo</strong> will always Fast-forward on a &ldquo;<em>git merge upstream/master</em>&rdquo;, the PlayScript repo will not, I only merge one branch/tag mono release at a time to <em>master branch</em> and then merge/rebase <em>playscript branch</em> in order to maintain my sanity (some of the internal API changes on even Mono minor releases can drive a person to drink).</p>

<p>So to quickly update my master mono as it will always fast-forward, I have a script in the root repo called <strong>mono-master-update-install.sh</strong>.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nb">cd</span> ../PlayScript-master
</span><span class='line'>git fetch upstream
</span><span class='line'>git merge upstream/master
</span><span class='line'>git push origin
</span><span class='line'>make
</span><span class='line'>make install
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can add the mono unit tests to the end of that script if you wish.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>:: I have the <strong>PlayScript-master</strong> <em>master branch</em> installing into a prefix of <u>~/mono-install</u> and the <strong>PlayScript</strong> <em>playscript branch</em> installing into the <u>~/playscript-install</u>. That way I can always switch quickly between the installed &lsquo;released&rsquo; Mono framework, the pure bleeding-edge mono build and the PlayScript build with a simple path change.</p>

    <updated>2014-04-22T18:35:15-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://sushihangover.github.io/blog/gcc-4-dot-9-is-out-with-arm-enhancements</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>GCC 4.9 is out with in the wild now with a long list of ARM enhancements. I&rsquo;m hoping to look at into a few of the items on their <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.9/changes.html">change/log list</a>.</p>

<p>One of them is the &ldquo;<strong>-mslow-flash-data</strong>&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m really interested in what they are doing when this option is used. Using QEMU and LLVM I create variable and function usage maps during the last stage of speed optimizations and tag the high use items to be moved to RX to any remaining XRW (RAM) during startup in the reset_handler (would really be nice to burn that routine in the feedback loop of the LLVM profiler, need to create perf records that could be fed to the <a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmdev/2014-April/072138.html">LLVM AutoFDO Converter</a> that Google did and have it spew out &lsquo;linker scriptets&rsquo;&hellip;. too many ideas, not enough time at get them all done ;-)</p>

<p>So what is listed in the man for &ldquo;-mslow-flash-data&rdquo; is:
<strong>Assume loading data from flash is slower than fetching instruction. Therefore literal load is minimized for better performance. This option is only supported when compiling for ARMv7 M-profile and off by default.</strong></p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Is ARMv6 M-profile really excluded in whatever they are doing with mslow-flash-data? Only M3 and M4x support? Need to find the commit(s) for this feature.'>
Is ARMv6 M-profile really excluded in whatever they are doing with mslow-flash-data? Only M3 and M4x support? Need to find the commit(s) for this feature.</p>

<p>Also everyone always loves items like: <strong>A number of code generation improvements for Thumb2 to reduce code size when compiling for the M-profile processors</strong>. Free code size reduction is always a great thing when during with those dirt-cheap <a href="http://www.nuvoton.com/NuvotonMOSS/Community/ProductInfo.aspx?tp_GUID=5dbf7d7a-b6df-4fe1-91c9-063449500ce7">Nuvoton NuMicro M0 chips</a>, well, assuming it comes with using &ldquo;-Os&rdquo; and not with a speed impact when throughput matters more&hellip; small is good, but it is not always what everyone needs.</p>

<p>And the &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_allocation">Local Register Allocator</a>&rdquo; is turned on for ARM by default:
<code>The Local Register Allocator, introduced in GCC 4.8.0 for ia32 and x86-64 targets only, is now used also on the Aarch64, ARM, S/390 and ARC targets by default..</code>
</span></p>

<p>Getting it compiled on OS-X proved to be a pain as I do not have a native build of GCC, just clang acting as gcc, and could not get a  ARM-NONE-EABI 4.9.0 version built using clang. One of the issues that I could not work around was:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>clang: error: unsupported option '-static-libgcc'</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Well, duh&hellip;, clang does not support that option, but not clear on why that is showing up under the 4.9.0 build using the same configure options as 4.8.x. Manually hacking on the make files to get passed this and I ended up getting into other issues, so I give up and built an OS-X &lsquo;native&rsquo; gcc that I then used to build the ARM-NONE-EABI cross-compiler to get around the orginal &ldquo;-static-libgcc&rdquo; issue. Never had any problems doing a &ldquo;make all-gcc&rdquo; or &ldquo;make all&rdquo; to build gcc 4.8.x with clang->gcc before.</p>

<p>So I build a native version on the master branch (4.10.x now):</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<li>Use of Advanced SIMD (Neon) for 64-bit scalar computations has been disabled by default. This was found to generate better code in only a small number of cases. It can be turned back on with the -mneon-for-64bits option.</li>
<li>Further support for the ARMv8-A architecture, notably implementing the restriction around IT blocks in the Thumb32 instruction set has been added. The -mrestrict-it option can be used with -march=armv7-a or the -march=armv7ve options to make code generation fully compatible with the deprecated instructions in ARMv8-A.</li>
<li>Support has now been added for the ARMv7ve variant of the architecture. This can be used by the -march=armv7ve option.</li>
<li>The ARMv8-A crypto and CRC instructions are now supported through intrinsics and are available through the -march=armv8-a+crc and mfpu=crypto-neon-fp-armv8 options.</li>
<li>LRA is now on by default for the ARM target. This can be turned off using the -mno-lra option. This option is purely transitionary command line option and will be removed in a future release. We are interested in any bug reports regarding functional and performance regressions with LRA.</li>
<li><strong>A new option -mslow-flash-data to improve performance of programs fetching data on slow flash memory has now been introduced for the ARMv7-M profile cores.</strong></li>
<li>A new option -mpic-data-is-text-relative for targets that allows data segments to be relative to text segments has been added. This is on by default for all targets except VxWorks RTP.</li>
<li>A number of infrastructural changes have been made to both the ARM and AArch64 backends to facilitate improved code-generation.</li>
<li>GCC now supports Cortex-A12 and the Cortex-R7 through the -mcpu=cortex-a12 and -mcpu=cortex-r7 options.</li>
<li>GCC now has tuning for the Cortex-A57 and Cortex-A53 through the -mcpu=cortex-a57 and -mcpu=cortex-a53 options.
Initial big.LITTLE tuning support for the combination of Cortex-A57 and Cortex-A53 was added through the -mcpu=cortex-a57.cortex-a53 option. Similar support was added for the combination of Cortex-A15 and Cortex-A7 through the -mcpu=cortex-a15.cortex-a7 option.</li>
<li>Further performance optimizations for the Cortex-A15 and the Cortex-M4 have been added.</li>
<li><p><strong> A number of code generation improvements for Thumb2 to reduce code size when compiling for the M-profile processors.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>AArch64:</strong></p></li>
<li>The ARMv8-A crypto and CRC instructions are now supported through intrinsics. These are enabled when the architecture supports these and are available through the -march=armv8-a+crc and -march=armv8-a+crypto options.</li>
<li>Initial support for ILP32 has now been added to the compiler. This is now available through the command line option -mabi=ilp32. + Support for ILP32 is considered experimental as the ABI specification is still beta.</li>
<li>Coverage of more of the ISA including the SIMD extensions has been added. The Advanced SIMD intrinsics have also been improved.</li>
<li>The new local register allocator (LRA) is now on by default for the AArch64 backend.</li>
<li>The REE (Redundant extension elimination) pass has now been enabled by default for the AArch64 backend.</li>
<li>Tuning for the Cortex-A53 and Cortex-A57 has been improved.</li>
<li>Initial big.LITTLE tuning support for the combination of Cortex-A57 and Cortex-A53 was added through the -mcpu=cortex-a57.cortex-a53 option.</li>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='LLVM 3.4.1 just incorporates stable bug-fixes while all major feature development is focused on landing for LLVM 3.5.'>
Doing point releases have been talked a lot about in the past but they&rsquo;ve never materialized up to now with this open-source compiler infrastructure seeing major releases once every six months. Fortunately, in covering the time until LLVM 3.5 in three months, LLVM 3.4.1 will finally be made. Tom Stellard at AMD who has been working a lot on the AMD LLVM GPU back-end and other open-source Radeon OpenCL code, has been organizing this point release management. The LLVM 3.4.1 release plans were originally shared last month. LLVM 3.4.1 just incorporates stable bug-fixes while all major feature development is focused on landing for LLVM 3.5.
</span></p>

<p>The official LLVM 3.4.1 release is planned for 4-18 assuming that all of the testing goes well. Details for testing can be found via the<a href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmdev/2014-April/072066.html"> LLVM mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>I am staying on the bleeding-edge for my bare metal ARM work, so I will continue to stay on the master branch (3.5.0):</p>

    <updated>2014-04-11T07:28:16-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://sushihangover.github.io/blog/arm-llvm-and-why-no-gpl</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a follow up to my last post about ARM&rsquo;s annoucement concerning their move to clang/LLVM.</p>

<p>Seems that more of the GPL-only mindset are upset that ARM is another company that is picking up and carrying the LLVM torch for their future development activities.</p>

<p>My take on it is it is a good thing, something they could not do with GCC without violating the GPL license that they would have to follow.  Clang/LLVM is licensed with a BSD-style license and not wanting to get in to a religious war over open source licensing, their LLVM selection and thus license choice allows them to keep things proprietary while working on new designs and code and releasing that to development partners like they currently do with their in-house ARM/Keli development environment. Then there is the problem of linking and including non-open code in end-user projects if they would have chosen GCC, this is a non-trivial problem for private and public companies dealing with IP that has extreme competition.</p>

<p>As ARM&rsquo;s new designs become public, they can then push LLVM changes to the public branch and, we as end-users, then get to enjoy the benefits of what they can release. Will there be code components that they alway keep private and/or charge for in their commerical &lsquo;ulitmate&rsquo; compiler version, maybe, but the code that does make it to the git repo will be vetted by the company that actually produces the MCU designs. Good enough for me, GPL be damned in this case&hellip;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Very cool news from ARM Holding the other day. They are formally adopting clang/LLVM as their future compiler. If you have been following LLVM commits, you might have noticed that AArch64 support has been making progress for quite some time, and now ARM is publicly releasing v6 of their compiler:</p>

<blockquote><p>ARM announces the availability of version 6 of the ARM Compiler, the reference code generation toolchain for the ARM® architecture. ARM Compiler 6 adopts the Clang and LLVM open source compiler framework, channeling contributions from the whole ARM Partnership to improve code quality, performance and power efficiency of software on ARM processors.</p>

<p>The flexible and modern Clang and LLVM infrastructure provides a solid foundation for ARM&rsquo;s code generation tools. Clang is a C/C++ compiler front end based on a modular architecture with well-defined interfaces for applying complimentary tools such as code analyzers and code generators. Clang also offers improved diagnostic capabilities, leading to higher quality code and shorter development cycles.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.arm.com/about/newsroom/arm-compiler-builds-on-open-source-llvm-technology.php">ARM&rsquo;s Press Release</a></p>

<p>I am really looking forward to when they start contributing on the existing Cortex-M backend in LLVM. :-)</p>

    <id>http://sushihangover.github.io/blog/qemu-machine-and-cpu-list</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page"><img class="left" src="http://sushihangover.github.io/images/QEMU_logo.png" title="&#34;QEMU&#34;" alt="&#34;QEMU&#34;"></a>I merged the latest changes from QEMU 2.0 RC master into the changes that I am making and noticed that since there is no default ARM &lsquo;machine&rsquo; any more, you can not get a cpu listing without giving it a machine:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>So now, you will need to include any machine (&ndash;machine help) in order to see the cpu listing, using the ARM Cortex-M0+ dev board that I am putting together (<em>sushi-m0plus-board</em>), you can get the cpu listing.</p>

    <id>http://sushihangover.github.io/blog/bkpt-service-calls-on-the-cortex-m0</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.openjtag.org"><img class="left" src="http://sushihangover.github.io/images/openjtag2_small.jpg" title="&#34;OpenJTAG&#34;" alt="&#34;OpenJTAG&#34;"></a> I tend to use semi-hosting via QEMU simluation and OpenJTAG/OpenOCD a lot; i.e.: for debugging, simulating sensor input and output, setting the RTC on a board for the first time and while the RMI Monitor interface is built-in to newlib stdio functions like printf, using a library like stdio is not really an option when a core only has 8k of ROM and 2k of RAM. So I need a really small printf routine to use on cores like the <a href="http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/prod_summary.jsp?code=KL03">Kinetis KL03</a> (MKL03Z32CAF4R)</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</span><span class='line'>  RAM (xrw)       : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 0x00800 /* 2K */
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There are a lot of embedded printf routines posted with a variety of features and mine is just a collection/combo of various standard practices. The main difference of mine is it normally uses SVC/BKPT routines to perform the &lsquo;print&rsquo; output and I <em>try</em> to make sure that optimizations via LLVM are taken advantage of.</p>

<p>So the question of how small of a routine is it as otherwise it is useless on something like the &lsquo;world&rsquo;s smallest ARM&rsquo; <a href="http://cache.freescale.com/files/microcontrollers/doc/fact_sheet/KINETISKL03CSPFS.pdf?fpsp=1&amp;Parent_nodeId=1390844042446720950044&amp;Parent_pageType=product">KL03</a>? Lets start with a newlib stdio version that uses the default syscalls that have RMI enabled. First you have to some heap as newlib printf using malloc.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>#include &lt;stdio.h>
</span><span class='line'>#include "printf_svc.h"
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>int main (void)
</span><span class='line'>{
</span><span class='line'>  printf("BKPT Hello World\n");
</span><span class='line'>  printf("How small is this?\n");
</span><span class='line'>  
</span><span class='line'>  svcExit(); // QEMU system exit
</span><span class='line'>  
</span><span class='line'>  while (1) { };
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The code size of the complete program above is huge if you are trying to run it on a Cortex-M0+ that only has 8K of ROM and 2k of RAM. Over 32K of ROM and 2+K of RAM just to output two lines of code!</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
</span><span class='line'>  33160    2304    1256   36720    8f70 bin/main.axf</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So lets use a printf that is self-contained and uses no heap (malloc) and update our test code:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Now that is more like it, 2k of ROM and 64 bytes of RAM: Debug code size:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
</span><span class='line'>   2102      64      10    2176     880 bin/main.axf</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In release configuration it is even better, ~1k of ROM is use, RAM is the same as expected; Release code size, LLVM compiled with -Os, linked with -O4:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
</span><span class='line'>   1106      64      10    1180     49c bin/main.axf</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Adding 10 more printf statements that each contain a <em>different</em> but static 10 char string only adds 210 bytes to the ROM. Removing the 100 bytes for static string allocation, that breaks down to 10 bytes for the printf call. This can be improved upon a little, but 10 bytes is acceptable for now.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
</span><span class='line'>   1316      64       8    1388     56c bin/main.axf</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p>A quick break down of elf size:</p>

<p><strong>text</strong>: your code, vector table plus constants.</p>

<p><strong>data</strong>: Initialized variables, and it counts for RAM and FLASH. The linker allocates data in FLASH which then is <em>copied</em> from ROM to RAM in the startup code (<em>in startup.c via the Reset_Handler function in my case</em>)</p>

<p><strong>bss</strong>: Uninitialized data in RAM which is initialized with zero in the startup code (<em>again see the Reset_Handler function</em>)</p>

    <id>http://sushihangover.github.io/blog/arm-compiler-price</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://sushihangover.github.io/images/ARM_DS5.jpg" title="&#34;ARM DS-5&#34;" alt="&#34;ARM DS-5&#34;"> I have been mainly using clang/llvm and GNU binutils for my ARM coding, along with arm-none-eabi-gcc for code comparisions against llvm.</p>

<p>But I was wondering how much <a href="http://ds.arm.com">ARM&rsquo;s DS-5</a> (Keil) IDE and compiler cost and found a couple of places in the &lsquo;net that actually publish the prices (like <a href="http://www.newark.com">Newark / Element14</a>):</p>

<h5>ARM DS-5 PROFESSIONAL:</h5>

<h5>Floating license price: $10,750.00 (USD)</h5>

<h5>Node locked price: $6,600.00 (USD)</h5>

<p>Ouch! I used their eval offer and if I was doing ARM coding full-time, yes, 10 grand for what they offer would be a no-brainer.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://sushihangover.github.io/images/ARM_DSTREAM.jpg" title="&#34;ARM DSTREAM&#34;" alt="&#34;ARM DSTREAM&#34;">What I really would like to have is the ARM/Keil <a href="http://ds.arm.com/ds-5/debug/dstream/">DStream</a> (debug &amp; trace unit) at <em>only</em> $3,500 USD (<a href="http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/DSTRM-KT-0181A/DSTRM-KT-0181A-ND/2522245">DigiKey</a>)&hellip;. damn is it nice, 4GB of trace buffer, 60 Mhz JTAG, etc&hellip;  But again like so many other embedded vendors they only offer Windows and Linux support. Never understood the standpoint of supporting Linux and not OS-X. Windows <strong>only</strong> support I actually understand from a marketshare point of view and optimizing drivers and software is a lot of work, but if you are going to support Linux, you might as well add another 5% to your dev budget and support OS-X.</p>

<p>Mfg Part No: <a href="http://www.newark.com/arm/dstrm-kt-0181a/debugtrace-unit-linux-for-arm/dp/75T9199">DSTRM-KT-0181A </a>: Price: $3500</p>
