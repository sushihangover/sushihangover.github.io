    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/PlayscriptLogo.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I posted up the PlayScript compiler (3.2.2002). This is the last posted release of the Apache licensed open-source version before Zynga pulled it from public domain.</p>

<p>I will be migrating it to the Mono 4.x compiler in the days and weeks ahead before working on finishing and getting the ActionScript language side stable (feature complete?). Not really looking forwarded to the Mono 4.x migration as the number of internal API changes to the mcs compiler since the 3.2.0 release is quite extensive.</p>

<p>If you want to compile and use the current 3.2.2002 release, just autogen.sh like normal.</p>

<p>Note: Due to dependency updates on OS-X since Mono 3.2 was release, I had to supply &ldquo; <u>&ndash;with-tls</u>&rdquo; option as it was auto-selecting <strong>__thread</strong> instead of <strong>_posix</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>./autogen.sh --with-tls=posix --enable-nls=no --prefix=/Users/administrator/mono-install
</code></pre>

<p>Note: Since this is mono 3.x, to build you will need gmcs during the bootstrap process. If you only have Mono 4.x installed, you will need a 3.x mono install to proceed. I just did a separate mono checkout of 3.2 and built it with a different install prefix location. When doing an initial/full compile and install, you can add this 3.2 install location to the front of your PATH and the default mono bootstrap will work cleanly.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the PlayScript work that I am doing on the Mono mcs compiler, keeping the PlayScript compiler in-sync with Mono&rsquo;s mcs can be a pain due to the large number of changes that occur on that repo.</p>

<p>While I have different &lsquo;tricks&rsquo; to try to help merging, the first thing is you have to keep one branch of your fork in-sync with the original repo that your forked, mono/mono.git in my case.</p>

<p>I created two local clones of my GitHub forked repo and added an &lsquo;upstream&rsquo; remote to the original mono repo.</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:bash %}
git remote -v
origin  <a href="https://github.com/sushihangover/PlayScript.git">https://github.com/sushihangover/PlayScript.git</a> (fetch)
origin  <a href="https://github.com/sushihangover/PlayScript.git">https://github.com/sushihangover/PlayScript.git</a> (push)
upstream    <a href="https://github.com/mono/mono.git">https://github.com/mono/mono.git</a> (fetch)
upstream    <a href="https://github.com/mono/mono.git">https://github.com/mono/mono.git</a> (push)
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>One local clone is named <strong>PlayScript-master</strong> and the other is <strong>PlayScript</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>PlayScript-master</strong> is used to keep in-sync with the upstream repo, build the bleed-edge mono framework and compiler and run the mono unit-tests. This is so I always know what the current mono master looks like and how the unit tests are running so I can review the changes I am making in the local <strong>PlayScript</strong> repo and make sure that I am not injecting regression failures in the C# side of the compiler. (I&rsquo;ll blog about that later). While the <strong>PlayScript-master repo</strong> will always Fast-forward on a &ldquo;<em>git merge upstream/master</em>&rdquo;, the PlayScript repo will not, I only merge one branch/tag mono release at a time to <em>master branch</em> and then merge/rebase <em>playscript branch</em> in order to maintain my sanity (some of the internal API changes on even Mono minor releases can drive a person to drink).</p>

<p>So to quickly update my master mono as it will always fast-forward, I have a script in the root repo called <strong>mono-master-update-install.sh</strong>.</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:bash %}
cd ../PlayScript-master
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
git push origin
make
make install
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can add the mono unit tests to the end of that script if you wish.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>:: I have the <strong>PlayScript-master</strong> <em>master branch</em> installing into a prefix of <u>~/mono-install</u> and the <strong>PlayScript</strong> <em>playscript branch</em> installing into the <u>~/playscript-install</u>. That way I can always switch quickly between the installed &lsquo;released&rsquo; Mono framework, the pure bleeding-edge mono build and the PlayScript build with a simple path change.</p>

    <id>http://sushihangover.github.io/blog/monomac-detect-when-mac-sleeps-or-wakes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Saw a question on the Xwt.Mac group concerning getting Sleep and Wake events from MonoMac/C# on OS-X. Normally I would look for those event on the NSApplication default notification center, but a quick look at the Apple developer site quickly directed me to the those events being on the NSWorkspace&rsquo;s notification center, so another quick look in MonoMac and lucky those are already exposed so you do not have to do the AddObserver work yourself, but finding them in the &lsquo;online MonoMac API&rsquo; did not return any direct results(?)&hellip; So here is my answer from that group in case anyone else google/bing this in the future:</p>

<p>Sleep and Wake are available on the NSWorkspace&rsquo;s notification center and MonoMac exposes those so so you do not have to write the AddObserver code yourself:</p>

<p>Apple Dev info on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/qa/qa1340/_index.html">NSWorkspaceWillSleepNotification &amp;NSWorkspaceDidWakeNotification</a></p>

<p>{% codeblock C# &ldquo;Wake and Sleep Events&rdquo; %}
Console.WriteLine (&ldquo;Add the sleep/wake observers&rdquo;);
NSWorkspace.Notifications.ObserveWillSleep ((object sender, NSNotificationEventArgs e) => {
    Console.Write (&ldquo;Your Mac is getting sleepy\n&rdquo;);
);
NSWorkspace.Notifications.ObserveDidWake ((object sender, NSNotificationEventArgs e) => {
    Console.Write (&ldquo;Time to go to work again\n&rdquo;);
};

<p>{% img left /images/Playscript404.gif 360 240 &lsquo;PlayScript, Going, going, gone&rsquo; %}
I am assuming with removal of PlayScript&rsquo;s public repo on GitHub that the project is either becoming a commercial offering from Xamarin (or Zynga) and future releases will have a license change?</p>

<p>I am assuming there will be some big reveal in the future when Xamarin (and Zynga?) announces Playscript is in Beta for licensed users of Studio, Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Andriod, &hellip;. Or Not&hellip;..</p>

<blockquote><p>The really important note here is if someone pulls a GitHub repo, you will <strong>LOSE</strong> your GitHub forks! Gone, Poof, No <em>Mas</em>, No warning, No chance to make a backup&hellip; I sure hope you had a complete local backup of your work cause it is now gone from GitHub</p></blockquote>
