<p>I posted up the initial fork of <a href="https://github.com/icsharpcode/NRefactory">NRefactory</a> that replaces the parser with the <a href="https://github.com/PlayScriptRedux/playscript">PlayScript</a> mcs compiler to allow PlayScript &amp; ActionScript parsing. This will be used within the <a href="https://github.com/PlayScriptRedux/PlayScript.Addin">Xamarin Studio / MonoDevelop PlayScript Language Addin</a>.</p>

<p>I do not normally use a Linux Desktop, more of a CLI kind-of guy, but in trying to support some C# projects that are using MonoDevelop, I needed to get the beta/alpha Mono builds installed&hellip; It turns out to be a <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pita&amp;page=1">P.I.T.A.</a> to do it from packages and not source.</p>

<p>Broken packages always seem to be a problem when dealing with pre-built Linux software and I usually build from source so I do not see them, but installing the <code>mono-devel</code> package fails due to <code>libjpeg62-turbo</code> and <code>libjpeg62</code> not being avialable in the normal Ubuntu repos. They have been replaced by bundle <code>8</code> of libraries but <code>libgdiplus</code> that Mono references is pinned to <code>libjpeg6*</code> packages&hellip;</p>

<h3>So the errors:</h3>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install mono-devel
</code></pre>

<pre><code>The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 mono-devel : Depends: libgdiplus (&gt;= 2.6.7) but it is not going to be installed
              Depends: libmono-system-design4.0-cil (&gt;= 1.0) but it is not going to be installed

<h3>The Fix:</h3>

<h4>Get the older <code>libjpeg62-turbo</code> package:</h4>

<p><a href="http://pkgs.org/debian-sid/debian-main-amd64/libjpeg62-turbo_1.4.1-2_amd64.deb.html">libjpeg62-turbo - libjpeg-turbo JPEG runtime library</a></p>

<pre><code> wget http://ftp.br.debian.org/debian/pool/main/libj/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg62-turbo_1.4.1-2_amd64.deb
</code></pre>

<h4>Get the older <code>libjpeg62</code> package:</h4>

<p><a href="http://pkgs.org/debian-sid/debian-main-amd64/libjpeg62_6b2-2_amd64.deb.html">libjpeg62 - Independent JPEG Group&rsquo;s JPEG runtime library (version 6.2)</a></p>

<pre><code> wget http://ftp.br.debian.org/debian/pool/main/libj/libjpeg6b/libjpeg62_6b2-2_amd64.deb
</code></pre>

<h4><a href="http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/ubuntu-linux-how-do-i-install-deb-packages/">Install</a> the deb packages:</h4>

<pre><code>sudo dpkg --install --recursive --auto-deconfigure libjpeg62-turbo_1.4.1-2_amd64.deb 
</code></pre>

<h4>Update and fix the &lsquo;now broken&rsquo; dependencies:</h4>

<pre><code>apt-get update
sudo apt-get -f install
</code></pre>

<h4>Finally, install <code>mono</code> (and <code>monodevelop</code>) from package:</h4>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install mono-devel
sudo apt-get isntall monodevelop
</code></pre>

<h4>Ahhh, <code>mono 4.2.1</code> is now installed:</h4>

<pre><code>mono --version

<p>Almost would be easier to install from source ;-)</p>

<p>Have fun.</p>

Many of these items revolve around arrays and vector and misuse of the generic (dynamic) Object types, but strings, associative operations, and nulls need some love also and his posts are very insightful as how C# is optimized in certain areas.</p>

    <link href="http://sushihangover.github.io/monos-new-tls-provider/"/>
    <updated>2015-10-26T23:10:57-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://sushihangover.github.io/monos-new-tls-provider</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Great news, the new pluggable TLS provider is available for security review.</p>

<p><a href="http://mono.1490590.n4.nabble.com/Mono-s-new-TLS-provider-tt4666825.html">Mono’s new TLS provider</a></p>

<blockquote><p> Hello,</p>

<p>As described by Miguel in the “State of Tls in Mono” [1] we have been working on a new TLS implementation for Mono, one that would upgrade our TLS stack, and one that would allow us to reuse some of the higher level pieces from Microsoft’s networking stack, read that post for more details on the scope of the project.</p>

<p>Mono’s master branch now has the ability to load alternative TLS implementations.   We added this code so we can start testing our new TLS implementation side-by-side the code that is in use today, and also so that we can provide both platform-specific backends or allow developers to choose a different TLS implementation (like BoringSSL, OpenSSL or Amazon’s s2n).</p>

<p>This is achieved by making our SSL transport pluggable, this allows HttpWebRequest and other classes to use the new TLS stack.</p>

<p>Today, a regular Mono checkout will default to the existing Mono SSL/TLS implementation which supports a number of ciphers and TLS levels up to 1.0, so nothing has changed and we have one alternative implementation available: mono-tls.</p>

<p>mono-tls is a purely managed implementation of TLS 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 (filling the gap that we had).   To use it, you need to build the mono-tls [2] module, once this is build, you will have to reference the following libraries: Mono.Security.NewTls, Mono.Security.NewTls.Interface, Mono.Security.Providers.NewTls.</p>

<p>Once you have these, you should add this code to your main program:</p>

<pre><code>  MonoTlsProviderFactory.InstallProvider (new NewTlsProvider ());
</code></pre>

<p>Then uses of HttpWebRequest, FtpWebRequest and the Smtp client will all use the new TLS stack.</p>

<p>More details are available in the architecture document [3].</p>

<p>TLS State
While we have added an extensive test suite to this new TLS implementation and tested this against a wide variety of TLS servers and configurations, we have not completed a security audit of its implementation.   While we have taken every step to ensure that we follow all the best practices when implementing a security stack, we want to get this code reviewed by third parties, and we want to complete a comprehensive security audit of the code before we would even consider transitioning this as the default.</p>

<p>Future Work - Pluggability/SslStream
We are going to be making the SslStream the proxy endpoint, for two reasons: (a) it would make SslStream usable with the new provider interface and (b) it would simplify some of the special code that lives in different places in the class libraries to use the new TLS implementation.</p>

<p>We will also likely introduce a MONO_TLS_PROVIDER environment variable that controls the implementation, so that we make it easier to test the implementations during the testing phase.</p>

<p>Future Work - Other Providers
We are currently developing a provider for Apple platforms that will use Apple’s unmanaged SSL implementation, and we will be adding an implementation that use Google’s BoringSSL.   The idea being that on Apple, you get to use the system provided implementation, and on other platforms, we use the Google maintained one.</p>

<p>Please let me know if you have any questions, comments, feedback.   In particular, we would like to get you to find security holes in the implementation.  We can offer a Xamarin shirt or a Xamarin monkey as a prize for finding holes in the new implementation.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Moving to El Capitan? Then you need <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/download/">Mono</a> version 4.2.x or 4.0.4.4.</p>

<p>From the Mono mailing list:</p>

<blockquote><p>What is the difference between the latest Mono 4.0.4.4 package for Mac and the 4.2.1 El Capitan Preview?
The changelog of 4.0.4.4 includes &ldquo;33585: El Capitan System Integrity
Protection support.&rdquo; so i suppose that the 4.0.4.4 also works on El
Capitan?.</p></blockquote>

<p>Reply from Miguel de Icaza:</p>

<blockquote><p>One is based on Mono 4.0 series, with minimal changes just to enable the support on El Capitan;   The 4.2 has the same changes, on top of the latest Mono 4.2, available on Alpha and the release candidate.</p></blockquote>
