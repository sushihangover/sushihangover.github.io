<p>I posted up the PlayScript compiler 3.2.3003 to <a href="https://github.com/sushihangover/playscript">Github</a> which fixes a bunch of build issues, including a clang/ld failure if you are running the latest and greatest version from Apple.</p>

<p>Root repo : playscript-small-build.sh</p>

<pre><code>./autogen.sh --with-mcs-docs=no --with-profile2=no --with-profile4=no --with-profile4_5=yes --with-moonlight=no --with-tls=posix --enable-nls=no --prefix=$HOME/playscript-install

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="/images/smartgit.png">  Surround your pullquote like this {" text to be quoted "}</p>

<p>When you are merging or rebasing hundreds of changing, doing that by hand from the cmd line is dreadful&hellip; I&rsquo;ve been merging the newer branches of Mono into PlayScript and it can be painful since the Apache open-source version PlayScript was pulled by Zynga from Github two years ago without warning.  When you are looking at hundreds of commits, and in a couple of cases, thousands of changes in between release tags and branches of Mono, doing that via the cmd line is doable, but it will give you nightmares. The SmartGui interface just works; walking the source tree, staging/unstaging, ours/theirs resolver, 3-way visual resolver/merge, markdown support, Github integration,  etc&hellip; is fast and clean&hellip;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve used a couple of other git GUIs and merging and rebasing in them just not seem intuitive and the speed of their interfaces when dealing with a repo as large as Mono is killing me and I&rsquo;ve ended up back in the cmd line.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to do a <a href="http://www.git-scm.com/downloads/guis">full and comparative review</a> as this product is free for noncommercial use, so download a copy and take it for a test drive yourself. I doubt you would will be disappointed.</p>

<p>I posted up the PlayScript compiler 3.2.3001 to <a href="https://github.com/sushihangover/playscript">Github</a> which is a merge of the mono-3.2.3 tag into the playscript-mono branch.</p>

<p>To speed up testing the merge, I am disabling a number of options in the build. Please log any issues via <a href="https://github.com/sushihangover/playscript/issues">Github</a></p>

<pre><code>./configure --with-mcs-docs=no --with-profile2=no --with-profile4=no --with-profile4_5=yes --with-moonlight=no --with-tls=posix --enable-nls=no --prefix=/Users/administrator/playscript-install

    <id>http://sushihangover.github.io/blog/playscript-3-dot-2-2002-posted</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/PlayscriptLogo.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I posted up the PlayScript compiler (3.2.2002). This is the last posted release of the Apache licensed open-source version before Zynga pulled it from public domain.</p>

<p>I will be migrating it to the Mono 4.x compiler in the days and weeks ahead before working on finishing and getting the ActionScript language side stable (feature complete?). Not really looking forwarded to the Mono 4.x migration as the number of internal API changes to the mcs compiler since the 3.2.0 release is quite extensive.</p>

<p>If you want to compile and use the current 3.2.2002 release, just autogen.sh like normal.</p>

<p>Note: Due to dependency updates on OS-X since Mono 3.2 was release, I had to supply &ldquo; <u>&ndash;with-tls</u>&rdquo; option as it was auto-selecting <strong>__thread</strong> instead of <strong>_posix</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>./autogen.sh --with-tls=posix --enable-nls=no --prefix=/Users/administrator/mono-install
</code></pre>

<p>Note: Since this is mono 3.x, to build you will need gmcs during the bootstrap process. If you only have Mono 4.x installed, you will need a 3.x mono install to proceed. I just did a separate mono checkout of 3.2 and built it with a different install prefix location. When doing an initial/full compile and install, you can add this 3.2 install location to the front of your PATH and the default mono bootstrap will work cleanly.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the PlayScript work that I am doing on the Mono mcs compiler, keeping the PlayScript compiler in-sync with Mono&rsquo;s mcs can be a pain due to the large number of changes that occur on that repo.</p>

<p>While I have different &lsquo;tricks&rsquo; to try to help merging, the first thing is you have to keep one branch of your fork in-sync with the original repo that your forked, mono/mono.git in my case.</p>

<p>I created two local clones of my GitHub forked repo and added an &lsquo;upstream&rsquo; remote to the original mono repo.</p>

<p><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>git remote -v
</span><span class='line'>origin  &lt;a <span class="nv">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;https://github.com/sushihangover/PlayScript.git&quot;</span>&gt;https://github.com/sushihangover/PlayScript.git&lt;/a&gt; <span class="o">(</span>fetch<span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>origin  &lt;a <span class="nv">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;https://github.com/sushihangover/PlayScript.git&quot;</span>&gt;https://github.com/sushihangover/PlayScript.git&lt;/a&gt; <span class="o">(</span>push<span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>upstream    &lt;a <span class="nv">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;https://github.com/mono/mono.git&quot;</span>&gt;https://github.com/mono/mono.git&lt;/a&gt; <span class="o">(</span>fetch<span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>upstream    &lt;a <span class="nv">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;https://github.com/mono/mono.git&quot;</span>&gt;https://github.com/mono/mono.git&lt;/a&gt; <span class="o">(</span>push<span class="o">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>One local clone is named <strong>PlayScript-master</strong> and the other is <strong>PlayScript</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>PlayScript-master</strong> is used to keep in-sync with the upstream repo, build the bleed-edge mono framework and compiler and run the mono unit-tests. This is so I always know what the current mono master looks like and how the unit tests are running so I can review the changes I am making in the local <strong>PlayScript</strong> repo and make sure that I am not injecting regression failures in the C# side of the compiler. (I&rsquo;ll blog about that later). While the <strong>PlayScript-master repo</strong> will always Fast-forward on a &ldquo;<em>git merge upstream/master</em>&rdquo;, the PlayScript repo will not, I only merge one branch/tag mono release at a time to <em>master branch</em> and then merge/rebase <em>playscript branch</em> in order to maintain my sanity (some of the internal API changes on even Mono minor releases can drive a person to drink).</p>

<p>So to quickly update my master mono as it will always fast-forward, I have a script in the root repo called <strong>mono-master-update-install.sh</strong>.</p>

<p><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nb">cd</span> ../PlayScript-master
</span><span class='line'>git fetch upstream
</span><span class='line'>git merge upstream/master
</span><span class='line'>git push origin
</span><span class='line'>make
</span><span class='line'>make install
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can add the mono unit tests to the end of that script if you wish.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>:: I have the <strong>PlayScript-master</strong> <em>master branch</em> installing into a prefix of <u>~/mono-install</u> and the <strong>PlayScript</strong> <em>playscript branch</em> installing into the <u>~/playscript-install</u>. That way I can always switch quickly between the installed &lsquo;released&rsquo; Mono framework, the pure bleeding-edge mono build and the PlayScript build with a simple path change.</p>
