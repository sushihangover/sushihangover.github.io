    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left <a" src="href="http://sushihangover.github.io/images/gitlogo.png">http://sushihangover.github.io/images/gitlogo.png</a>"> After you perform a fetch on an upstream or someone&rsquo;s forked repo, you want to review the changes before committing them.</p>

<p>You can not do a what-if or a dry-run merge but it does not matter as git is your friend in this matter. Just do the merge and review it, BUT, do not let it commit or fast forward during the merge.</p>

<pre><code>git merge --no-commit --no-ff branchname
</code></pre>

<p>Without the <strong>&ndash;no-ff</strong> flag, if Git can do a fast-forward then it will do that and commit anyway <em>despite</em> the &ndash;no-commit flag.</p>

<p>Setup an alias in your ~/.gitconfig for a simple shortcut</p>

<pre><code>review = merge --no-ff --no-commit
</code></pre>

<p>So in looking at upstream changes:</p>

<pre><code>git fetch upstream
git review upstream/master
git status
</code></pre>

<p>If you wish to back those changes, just reset that merge:</p>

<pre><code>git reset --merge
</code></pre>

    <id>http://sushihangover.github.io/git-your-githubs-fork-pull-request-is-rejected-kind-of-now-what</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left <a" src="href="http://sushihangover.github.io/images/gitlogo.png">http://sushihangover.github.io/images/gitlogo.png</a>"> So you have a Github fork of a project and you find a problem. You whip up a fix, commit it in a local branch and push it to your fork you Github. Than you issue a pull request to the upstream repo. Life is good. <img class="right <a" src="href="http://sushihangover.github.io/images/github_logo.png">http://sushihangover.github.io/images/github_logo.png</a>"></p>

<p>But&hellip; your pull request is &lsquo;rejected&rsquo;, kind-of, as the fix is applied differently to their branch. Now your GitHub and local repo are history mismatched to the upstream master. Fetching upstream and merging upstream/master produces conflicts ;-(</p>

<p>First, I do not want to lose the commit that I did do. I want to keep the work/history so a &lsquo;simple&rsquo; git hard reset to a prior sha is out of the question.</p>

<p>So lets put your changes on a new branch and reset the master branch back to match the upstream.</p>

<h3>Move last commit to a new branch</h3>

<p>Note: You <em>will</em> lose uncommitted work, stash first if needed!</p>

<pre><code>git branch newbranch
git reset --hard HEAD~1 # Go back 1 commit or use SHA
git checkout newbranch
</code></pre>

<h3>Re-sync your Github fork</h3>

<p>Now, lets get everything re-sync&rsquo;d.</p>

<pre><code>git checkout master
</code></pre>

<p>Since you already push this branch to your Github fork, you will see the message:</p>

<pre><code>"Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded."
</code></pre>

<p>That contains <em>your</em> fix, but you need to merge in the upstream/master changes.</p>

<pre><code>git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
</code></pre>

<p>And your local master should <em>Fast-forward</em> to match the upstream. All is good, except your repo on Github is not correct as it contains your original commit on the wrong branch.</p>

<pre><code>git push --force
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to keep (backup) that new branch to Github than use the following instead:</p>

<pre><code>git push --all --force
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You should not be forcing a push if others have already pulled from your repo/fork. That causes bad git mojo and everyone else that pulled your repo will need to be notified that you &lsquo;changed&rsquo; history&hellip; That is a git fixup story for another day.</p>

<h3>Moral of the story:</h3>

<p>Create a bugfix branch with your fixes. It should have one commit (rebase if needed) that will fast-forward and issue your pull-request from that branch.</p>

    <updated>2015-06-14T14:57:37-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://sushihangover.github.io/git-set-up-a-fetch-only-remote</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left <a" src="href="http://sushihangover.github.io/images/gitlogo.png">http://sushihangover.github.io/images/gitlogo.png</a>"> The PlayScript repo on the <a href="https://github.com/PlayScriptRedux">PlayScriptRedux</a> Github organization I maintain is a down-stream fork of <a href="https://github.com/mono/mono">Mono</a> so I can fetch the changes to their master branch. I also have my own <a href="https://github.com/sushihangover/playscript">fork</a> of the PlayScript repo so I can code, issue pull-requests and review other people&rsquo;s pull-requests. But I do not want to screw up and push directly to the <a href="https://github.com/PlayScriptRedux/playscript">Redux based repo</a> from my local repo, only my own fork on GitHub. Also I do not have any push permissions on the Mono repo and want to not even have git try to push to that repo if I screw up on the cmd line.</p>

<p>So after adding my additional remotes my local repo, it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/sushihangover/playscript.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/sushihangover/playscript.git (push)
redux   https://github.com/PlayScriptRedux/playscript.git (fetch)
redux   https://github.com/PlayScriptRedux/playscript.git (push)
upstream    https://github.com/mono/mono.git (fetch)
upstream    https://github.com/mono/mono.git (push)
</code></pre>

<p>I want to keep the fetch/pull ability from the redux and upstream remotes and remove the  &lsquo;push&rsquo; ability to those remotes.</p>

<p>You can not totally clear the push uri as it will be replaced with the fetch uri. So setting the push uri to something nonexistent works, i.e.</p>

<pre><code> git remote set-url --push upstream DISABLE
 git remote set-url --push redux DISABLE
</code></pre>

<p>And to see what that looks like now:</p>

<pre><code>git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/sushihangover/playscript.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/sushihangover/playscript.git (push)
redux   https://github.com/PlayScriptRedux/playscript.git (fetch)
redux   DISABLE (push)
upstream    https://github.com/mono/mono.git (fetch)
upstream    DISABLE (push)
</code></pre>

<p>Now if you push to the one of the &lsquo;disable&rsquo; remotes, you will recieve the following error:</p>

<pre><code>git push redux
fatal: 'DISABLE' does not appear to be a git repository
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
</code></pre>

<p>NOTE: You do not have to use &ldquo;DISABLE&rdquo;, any nonsensical URI will do. I like DISABLE as seeing it in the git push error message is a clear indicator of the brain fart that I just typed&hellip;</p>

<p>The new org is named <a href="https://github.com/PlayScriptRedux">PlayScriptRedux</a> and any forks should be made from there as it will be the master and now my personal PlayScript repo will also be a fork of that master.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be (slowly) posting the other PlayScript related repo (Starling, Away3d, IDE add-ins, etc.) to the PlayScriptRedux as they are tested.</p>

    <link href="http://sushihangover.github.io/octopress-deploy-and-update-git-source/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/Octopress_logo.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I use <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> for this <a href="https://github.com/sushihangover">GitHub</a> blog and can tend to forget to push the source to Github as it is not part of the &lsquo;rake deploy&rsquo;.</p>

<p>&lsquo;rake deploy&rsquo; only updates the master branch on Github on order to publish the website and instead of hack'ing the deploy function to handle pushing the &lsquo;'source&rsquo; branch also (waiting on the Octopress 3.0 release for that), I wrote a script to handle it all.</p>

<p>This <em>lazy</em> script that does all the steps that I would have to do manually but tend to never do. And it is in my root Octopress directory so it included in my source revisions ;-)</p>

<p>Nothing special: just generates, deploys, adds all on the source branch along with a commit and push. For good measure it then garbage collects the repo to keep everything clean.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash
echo "Generate and deploying website"
rake generate
rake deploy
echo "Commiting and pushing source files"
git add --all; 
git commit -m "New posts"; 
git push 
git gc
pushd _deploy
git gc
popd
