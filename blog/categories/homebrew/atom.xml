<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of <a href="http://brew.sh">Homebrew</a> on OS-X and it normally it works so well that you just do not think about it. That is a very good thing, it just works, does not get in your way and anything is good.</p>

<p>While I was updating/upgrading packages today, I ended up running &lsquo;brew info&rsquo;:</p>

<pre><code>brew info 
146 kegs, 171208 files, 8.0G
</code></pre>

<p>I was surprised that I had 8 GBs of hard drive space consumed by brew packages. If you did not know it, brew does not auto-purge older packages.</p>

<p>{% blockquote %}
From  FAQ:
By default, Homebrew does not uninstall old versions of a formula, so over time you will accumulate old versions.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/FAQ.md">https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/FAQ.md</a>
{% endblockquote %}</p>

<p>It had been a long time since I did a cleanup in brew and I had well over a hundred older versions of various packages that I was not using (i.e. one that were not pinned; <em>brew pin {FORMULA</em>), so I ran the cleanup and freed up 7.3 GB of drive space.</p>

<pre><code>brew info 
146 kegs, 63167 files, 2.7G
</code></pre>

<p>Clean up everything at once:</p>

<pre><code>brew cleanup
</code></pre>

<p>Clean up just one formula:</p>

<pre><code>brew cleanup {FORMULA}
</code></pre>

<p>Do a dry run to see what would be cleaned up:</p>

<pre><code>brew cleanup -n
</code></pre>

    <id>http://sushihangover.github.io/homebrew-git-1-dot-9-0-release</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Update: Someone else has done a pull-request for homebrew git that is awaiting cool down on the new 1.9.0 release before it gets mainlined. As the formula is the basically the same as mine you can grab it via the <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/pull/26734">pull-request</a> on github and post 1.9.0 issues/comments in that thread.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://code.google.com/p/git-core/">Git</a> just released <a href="https://code.google.com/p/git-core/downloads/detail?name=git-1.9.0.tar.gz">1.9.0</a> (Feb-14-2014) but <a href="http://brew.sh">Homebrew</a> does not have this update quite yet so I updated the tar ball references, sha1 tags and commented out the patch that is no longer required (this needs cleaned up as there are older patches commented out also&hellip;). As for the complete release notes, click <a href="http://anzwix.com/a/Git/Git190">here</a>.</p>

<p>I do not have time right now to do a pull-request, so here is a <a href="https://gist.github.com">gist</a> of it so you can update your Git version. Do a &ldquo;brew edit git&rdquo; and replace the contents with this and you can update to 1.9.0.</p>
