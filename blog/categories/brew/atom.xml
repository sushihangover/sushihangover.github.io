<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of <a href="http://brew.sh">Homebrew</a> on OS-X and it normally it works so well that you just do not think about it. That is a very good thing, it just works, does not get in your way and anything is good.</p>

<p>While I was updating/upgrading packages today, I ended up running &lsquo;brew info&rsquo;:</p>

<pre><code>brew info 
146 kegs, 171208 files, 8.0G
</code></pre>

<p>I was surprised that I had 8 GBs of hard drive space consumed by brew packages. If you did not know it, brew does not auto-purge older packages.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>From  FAQ:<br/>By default, Homebrew does not uninstall old versions of a formula, so over time you will accumulate old versions.</p></p><p><p><a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/FAQ.md">https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/FAQ.md</a></p></blockquote></p>

<p>It had been a long time since I did a cleanup in brew and I had well over a hundred older versions of various packages that I was not using (i.e. one that were not pinned; <em>brew pin {FORMULA</em>), so I ran the cleanup and freed up 7.3 GB of drive space.</p>

<pre><code>brew info 
146 kegs, 63167 files, 2.7G
</code></pre>

<p>Clean up everything at once:</p>

<pre><code>brew cleanup
</code></pre>

<p>Clean up just one formula:</p>

<pre><code>brew cleanup {FORMULA}
</code></pre>

<p>Do a dry run to see what would be cleaned up:</p>

<pre><code>brew cleanup -n
</code></pre>
