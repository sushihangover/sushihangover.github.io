When using .Net libraries that have native binding and you are receiving errors like
&ldquo;<strong>Unable to find the xxxx native library</strong>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<strong>DllImport error loading library</strong>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>You can easily find where mono is looking for that native library by setting the MONO_LOG_LEVEL to debug and filtering (MONO_LOG_MASK) the debug to just DLL related messages.</p>

<pre><code>export MONO_LOG_LEVEL=debug
export MONO_LOG_MASK=dll
mono yourprogram.exe
</code></pre>

<p>I was recently using the mono-curses, or at least trying to ;-) and I knew my DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH was set properly to pick up the &ldquo;libmono-curses.dylib&rdquo; that I just built. But I set the MONO_LOG_LEVEL and MONO_LOG_MASK env vars and re-run the program and yes it was finding the dylib OK but it was complaining about it being the wrong architecture&hellip;</p>

<pre><code>Mono: DllImport attempting to load: 'libmono-curses.dylib'.
Mono: DllImport error loading library '/Users/administrator/Documents/Code/github/mono-curses/libmono-curses.dylib': 'dlopen(/Users/administrator/Documents/Code/github/mono-curses/libmono-curses.dylib, 9): no suitable image found.
Did find:  /Users/administrator/Documents/Code/github/mono-curses/libmono-curses.dylib: mach-o, but wrong architecture        
</code></pre>

<p>Checking with file and yes, it was a 32-bit version of the library</p>

<pre><code>file libmono-curses.dylib
libmono-curses.dylib: Mach-O dynamically linked shared library i386
</code></pre>

<p>I am compiling using a 64-bit version of Mono on OS-X, so a quick fix in the mono-curses Makefile and re-compile and I have a 64-bit version.</p>

<pre><code>file libmono-curses.dylib 
libmono-curses.dylib: Mach-O 64-bit dynamically linked shared library x86_64
</code></pre>

<p>After that, testing the C# ncurses wrapper test went fine&hellip; ;-)</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.mono-project.com/docs/advanced/pinvoke/#mac-os-x-framework-and-dylib-search-path">Mac OS X Framework and .dylib Search Path</a></h2>

<h3>The Framework and library search path is:</h3>

<ul>
<li>A colon-separated list of directories in the user’s DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH environment variable.</li>
<li>A colon-separated list of directories in the user’s DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.</li>
<li><p>A colon-separated list of directories in the user’s DYLD_FALLBACK_FRAMEWORK_PATH environment variable, which defaults to the directories:</p>

<pre><code>  ~/Library/Frameworks
  /Library/Frameworks
  /Network/Library/Frameworks
  /System/Library/Frameworks
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>A colon-separated list of directories in the user’s DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable, which defaults to the directories:</p>

<pre><code>  ~/lib
  /usr/local/lib
  /lib
  /usr/lib
</code></pre></li>
</ul>


<p>Note: Mono will automatically append the appropriate suffix depending on the platform (.dylib on Mac, .so on Linux and .dll on Windows).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/Homebrew_logo.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of <a href="http://brew.sh">Homebrew</a> on OS-X and it normally it works so well that you just do not think about it. That is a very good thing, it just works, does not get in your way and anything is good.</p>

<p>While I was updating/upgrading packages today, I ended up running &lsquo;brew info&rsquo;:</p>

<pre><code>brew info 
146 kegs, 171208 files, 8.0G
</code></pre>

<p>I was surprised that I had 8 GBs of hard drive space consumed by brew packages. If you did not know it, brew does not auto-purge older packages.</p>

<p>{% blockquote %}
From  FAQ:
By default, Homebrew does not uninstall old versions of a formula, so over time you will accumulate old versions.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/FAQ.md">https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/FAQ.md</a>
{% endblockquote %}</p>

<p>It had been a long time since I did a cleanup in brew and I had well over a hundred older versions of various packages that I was not using (i.e. one that were not pinned; <em>brew pin {FORMULA</em>), so I ran the cleanup and freed up 7.3 GB of drive space.</p>

<pre><code>brew info 
146 kegs, 63167 files, 2.7G
</code></pre>

<p>Clean up everything at once:</p>

<pre><code>brew cleanup
</code></pre>

<p>Clean up just one formula:</p>

<pre><code>brew cleanup {FORMULA}
</code></pre>

<p>Do a dry run to see what would be cleaned up:</p>

<pre><code>brew cleanup -n
</code></pre>

    <updated>2014-02-19T20:56:11-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://sushihangover.github.io/using-diffmerge-as-your-git-visual-merge-and-diff-tool</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/images/diffmerge_large.png">{% img right /images/diffmerge_small.png &ldquo;LLVM vs. GCC code generation for Bare Metal ARM development&rdquo; %}</a>
I tend to stay on the cmd line as much as possible, but for visual diffs, an ncurses console diff tool just does not cut it for me. <a href="http://www.scootersoftware.com/moreinfo.php">Beyond Compare Pro</a> by <a href="http://www.scootersoftware.com/index.php">Scooter</a> on Windows is one of best that I have ever used and with licenses at work I never had to worry about not having it on a work desktop or laptop.</p>

<p>But on OS-X at home, Beyond Compare was not available. There is a 4.0 release in the works (beta now), but $50.00 USD for a personal-use copy on OS-X and not having feature parity with Windows Pro features(?), I just can not pull the trigger on that purchuse when there are other
(cheaper) options that work just as well for personal development.</p>

<p>So, normally for a <strong>free</strong> visual diff, you can not beat <a href="http://meldmerge.org">meld</a>, it is a great open-source tool, but on OS-X it fires up X (Quartz for me) and it getting long in the tooth in terms of the GUI&rsquo;s human factors (feature set is still great). If there was a Qt version of this, the search would be over&hellip; free or not!</p>

<p>So some searching landed me on an old post by <a href="http://twobitlabs.com/2011/08/install-diffmerge-git-mac-os-x/">Todd Huss</a> about using DiffMerge as your visual diff/merge for git and it was actually what I was looking for, well almost ;-) It is missing a few features, but they have a free version and it works really well and has a great OS-X interface&hellip; search is over for now&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/diffmerge/">SourceGear</a> has a $19.00 USD version that include file export with HTML formatting and if I could see example HTML code that it produces, I pay for that feature in a heart-beat, but the feature is completely locked out till you actaully register, bummer&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>Todd recommends using the DiffMerge installer version vs. the dmg version, I go the other way on that. Download the dmg version, open it and drag/drop the app to your Applications. Then in a term window you can copy the <em>Extras/diffmerge.sh</em> to your <em>/usr/local/bin</em> directory (Execute attrib is already set, so no chmod needed..), but I copied it as just <em>vdiff</em> as that is quicker to type. No admin rights are need to install it that way and that makes me happy&hellip; I can <em>vdiff file1.c file2.c</em> on the cmd line to pop the GUI open and populate it.</p>

<p>I then used the git setup he has listed and everything is working great so far. Click on the image above to it comparing the disassembly of <a href="/images/diffmerge_large.png">LLVM vs. GCC code generation for bare metal ARM</a> development.</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:bash Your git setup is: %}
git config &ndash;global diff.tool diffmerge
git config &ndash;global difftool.diffmerge.cmd &lsquo;diffmerge &ldquo;$LOCAL&rdquo; &ldquo;$REMOTE&rdquo;&rsquo;
git config &ndash;global merge.tool diffmerge
git config &ndash;global mergetool.diffmerge.cmd &lsquo;diffmerge &ndash;merge &ndash;result=&ldquo;$MERGED&rdquo; &ldquo;$LOCAL&rdquo; &ldquo;$(if test -f &rdquo;$BASE"; then echo &ldquo;$BASE&rdquo;; else echo &ldquo;$LOCAL&rdquo;; fi)&ldquo; &rdquo;$REMOTE"&rsquo;
git config &ndash;global mergetool.diffmerge.trustExitCode true
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>{% codeblock lang:bash Your git shortcuts are: linenos:false %}</p>

<h1>diff the local file.m against the checked-in version</h1>

<p>git difftool file.m</p>

<h1>diff the local file.m against the version in some-feature-branch</h1>

<p>git difftool some-feature-branch file.m</p>

<h1>diff the file.m from the Build-54 tag to the Build-55 tag</h1>

<p>git difftool Build-54..Build-55 file.m</p>

<h1>To resolve merge conflicts, just run git mergetool:</h1>

<p>git mergetool
{% endcodeblock %}</p>

<p>Thanks <a href="http://twobitlabs.com">Todd</a>, works great.</p>

    <id>http://sushihangover.github.io/building-lldb-on-mac-os-x</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<pre><code>/llvm/tools/lldb/tools/debugserver/source/MacOSX/dbgnub-mig.defs:13:10: fatal error: 'DNBConfig.h' file not found
#include "DNBConfig.h"
         ^
1 error generated.
</code></pre>

<p>I was trying to build LLDB &lsquo;out-of-source&rsquo; at the same time as LLVM, Polly, cloog, libcxx, etc&hellip; using ninja and got the error above. Missing source from a LLVM sub-project? I really doubted that and was right&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>DNBConfig.h is autogenerated by a perl script that is run as a build script in XCode. XCode is responsible for calling the script and setting the include paths correctly to locate it. The file will exist in the derived sources directory in the build folder.</p></blockquote>

<p>Well, the <a href="http://lldb.llvm.org/build.html">LLDB build instructions</a> are <em>clear</em> in that you need to build lldb from Xcode when on OS-X but I &lsquo;assumed&rsquo; that the <em>make</em> would call &ldquo;"xcodebuild -workspace lldb.xcworkspace -configuration Release -scheme LLVB clean build&rdquo; or some like that to build it&hellip; but I assumed wrong :-( &hellip; thus your ninja/make build will always fail&hellip;</p>

<p>I also can not find a disable option for LLDB when running llvm&rsquo;s &lsquo;configure&rsquo;, so if you have the lldb source in llvm/tools your configure will always include it and thus your build will always fail..?&hellip;</p>

<p>Why is this? Is this due to Apple preventing an <strong><em>un-codesigned</em></strong> version to be built/run on OS-X? Really confused by the whole thing. If someone knows, ping me&hellip; thanks&hellip;</p>

<p>Note: This is only on OS-X, building LLDB that has been included under llvm/tools under Linux/FreeBSD works as expected&hellip;</p>
