I needed to convert some Java code to C# and one of the best ways that I ever found is to use `Sharpen`. This used to be available as a Eclipse plugin but you can find a cli version at Mono's Github account:

* [https://github.com/mono/sharpen](https://github.com/mono/sharpen)

One of the *issues* in running Sharpen is that it requires Java 1.7, **NOT 1.6, nor 1.8.**.

So you need to have a Java 7 install. An easy way if you are already using homebrew, is available via a cask:

	brew install Caskroom/versions/java7

Note: If you get errors, make sure that your casks are updated, `brew upgrade brew-cask`

####Current JDK:
 
	/usr/libexec/java_home
	/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_92.jdk/Contents/Home

####Get a list of Install JDKs:

	ls -l1 /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/
	1.6.0.jdk
	jdk1.7.0_71.jdk
	jdk1.7.0_80.jdk
	jdk1.8.0_92.jdk

####Export a "new home":

	export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_80.jdk/Contents/Home

Now I can build and run `sharpen`, i.e.:

	mvn clean test
	mvn install
	java -jar src/target/sharpencore-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar /Users/sushi/github/PlayParser
