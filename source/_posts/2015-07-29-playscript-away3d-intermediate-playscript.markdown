This demo uses the the Away3d Intermediate Particle Explosions example as a base, but I reworked it slightly to use the PlayScript logo. It is running via Mono and Xamarin Studio using the [PlayScript](http://playscriptredux.github.io) compiler. [Fork](https://github.com/playscriptredux/playscript) me on github.
