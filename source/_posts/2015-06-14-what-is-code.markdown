No matter what the [Slate](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2015/06/11/bloomberg_businessweek_s_38_000_word_piece_on_code_just_try_coding_yourself.html) says, Paul Ford's "[What is Code](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/)" desires to be read, if not by every programmer, then surely by every person that has to deal with programmers.

The best thing, if you find any issues with the article, you can post a [Github issue](https://github.com/BloombergMedia/whatiscode/issues/new), I did. ;-)
