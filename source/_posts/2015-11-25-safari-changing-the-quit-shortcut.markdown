{% img left /images/OS-X-Safari-Quit.png Quit %}I tend to hit the `Cmd-Q` instead of `Cmd-W` when I am closing a tab and in my older installs on OS-X I had changed the shortcut for `Safari Quit` and that is one thing (among others) that I did not migrate to my new OS-X 10.11 install.

So, open up `System Perferences` and go to `KeyBoards` and then the `Shortcuts` pane and **add** an `App Shortcuts` for Safari only for the menu item called `Quit Safari`, mine now is `Ctrl-CMD-Q`:
