{% img left http://sushihangover.github.io/images/PlayscriptLogo_small.png %}  I posted up the PlayScript compiler 3.2.5001 to [GitHub](https://github.com/sushihangover/playscript) which is a merge of the remote-tracking branch 'upstream/mono-3.2.5-branch' into playscript-mono

Been knocking these simple minors versions out, dreading the upcoming Mono 4.x changes...

Setting up a GitHub organization for PlayScript, I'll let you know when it is up.
