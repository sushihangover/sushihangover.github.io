Have problems trying to install Adobe Air on a fresh install of OS-X 10.11? The current version of the installer that linked @ https://get.adobe.com/air/ will just hang and you will have to `force` quit it.


Try the latest[ Adobe Air Beta](http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/air.html) 20 and your problems will be sovled.

Note: This also solves the issue for older versions of Adobe CS (6 and others) failing to install properly. Install the latest Air version and retry your Adove CS install.
