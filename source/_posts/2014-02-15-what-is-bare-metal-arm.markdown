## What is Bare Metal ARM Development?

> Bare-Metal ARM Development, also called [Bare-Machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_machine) is the development of 'embedded' applications, that run without an operating system or other supporting programs, maybe a bootloader, on an ARM processor. The application sits on top of the “bare metal”, runs ARM instructions (including THUMB), directly controls the processor (MCU) to manage power consumption, GPIOs, ADC, DAC, etc...
