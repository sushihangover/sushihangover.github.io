{% blockquote "Valentin Angelovski" http://www.fleasystems.com/fleaFPGA.html %}
FleaFPGA provides a low-cost development platfrom for users to explore the wonders of programmable logic and hardware-oriented languages i.e. VHDL and Verilog. FleaFPGA is suited for professional and hobbyist uses.
{% endblockquote %}


Valentin is looking at producing at limited run of his [Lattice](http://www.latticesemi.com/Products/FPGAandCPLD.aspx) MachXO2-based [FleaFPGA boards](http://www.fleasystems.com/fleaFPGA.html) that are designed to get beginners up, running and experimentings with FPGA programming quickly. For ~100.00 sounds like a great deal. Head over to his site and [pre-order](http://www.fleasystems.com/forums/showthread.php?tid=29&pid=127#pid127) one.
