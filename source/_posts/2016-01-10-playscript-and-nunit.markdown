{% img left http://sushihangover.github.io/images/PlayscriptLogo_small.png %} I've add a NUnit template to the [PlayScriptRedux/PlayScript.Addin](https://github.com/PlayScriptRedux/PlayScript.Addin)

I do not have a website for the `.mpack` setup yet, so grab the latest release [here](https://github.com/PlayScriptRedux/PlayScript.Addin/releases).

###MonoDevelop.PlayScript_5.10.2.2.mpack

####New:

* Added NUnit template

###Prior:
* Support for the nuget feed (https://www.myget.org/F/playscript/)
* Initial Release for Xamarin Studio v5.10.2.0+

Functional, but it still needs a lot of love to be on par with CSharp's NRefactory...
