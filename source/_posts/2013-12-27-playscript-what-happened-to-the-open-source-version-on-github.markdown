Poof: An open source project disappears: https://github.com/playscript/playscript-mono.git

{% img left /images/Playscript404.gif 360 240 'PlayScript, Going, going, gone' %}
I am assuming with removal of PlayScript's public repo on GitHub that the project is either becoming a commercial offering from Xamarin (or Zynga) and future releases will have a license change? 

I am assuming there will be some big reveal in the future when Xamarin (and Zynga?) announces Playscript is in Beta for licensed users of Studio, Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Andriod, .... Or Not.....

> The really important note here is if someone pulls a GitHub repo, you will **LOSE** your GitHub forks! Gone, Poof, No *Mas*, No warning, No chance to make a backup... I sure hope you had a complete local backup of your work cause it is now gone from GitHub
