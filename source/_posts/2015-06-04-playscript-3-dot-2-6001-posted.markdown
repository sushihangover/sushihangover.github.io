{% img left http://sushihangover.github.io/images/PlayscriptLogo_small.png %}  I posted up the PlayScript compiler 3.2.6001 to [GitHub](https://github.com/sushihangover/playscript) which is a merge of the remote-tracking branch 'upstream/mono-3.2.6-branch' into playscript-mono

FYI: I have been using tags on the playscript-mono branch to mark each of these PlayScript merges. It is a clean and lightweight way to capture and identity these version on the timeline:

    git tag --list | grep playscript
    playscript-3.2.2002
    playscript-3.2.3001
    playscript-3.2.3003
    playscript-3.2.4001
    playscript-3.2.5001
    playscript-3.2.6001
