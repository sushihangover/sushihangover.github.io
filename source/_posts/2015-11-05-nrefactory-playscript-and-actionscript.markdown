I posted up the initial fork of [NRefactory](https://github.com/icsharpcode/NRefactory) that replaces the parser with the [PlayScript](https://github.com/PlayScriptRedux/playscript) mcs compiler to allow PlayScript & ActionScript parsing. This will be used within the [Xamarin Studio / MonoDevelop PlayScript Language Addin](https://github.com/PlayScriptRedux/PlayScript.Addin).

Fork and clone it and give the `ICSharpCode.NRefactory.GtkDemo` project a try.
