###Using Git:

[![If that doesn't fix it, git.txt contains the phone number of a friend of mine who understands git. Just wait through a few minutes of 'It's really pretty simple, just think of branches as...' and eventually you'll learn the commands that will fix everything.](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png)](http://www.xkcd.com/1597/)

###Git Commit:

[![Merge branch 'asdfasjkfdlas/alkdjf' into sdkjfls-final](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git_commit.png)](http://xkcd.com/1296/)
